### Exercise: Affirmative Action

The University of Liberalland (U of L) is the state's flagship university, and has very high admissions standards. However, it has many more students who apply each year than meet its standards. Its medical school, in particular, is very prestigious and accepts far fewer students each year than it would like to, were teaching resources unlimited.

Recently, several studies have been published suggesting that medical care for patients from disadvantaged groups is significantly enhanced by having doctors who are members of those groups, and who can empathize with the difficulties experienced by those communities. As it turns out, Liberalland has several major urban areas with lower-income, racially segregated, inner cities, and with distinctive health problems rooted in the conditions of those areas (crime, lack of access to healthy food, mold/lead poisoning and other housing deficiencies,Â the physical consequences of stress from racial discrimination, etc.), and doctors from U of L often end up working in hospitals that serve those areas.

You're the general counsel of the U of L. The dean of the medical school comes to you to ask your advice about several potential policies to better serve these communities. These include:

- Creating a special admissions track for students who are from the economic, racial, and geographic backgrounds reflected in the above-noted areas (ERGB students).

- Funding special scholarships for ERGB students who commit to working in the relevant areas.

- Randomly selecting the class from among qualified applicants, in the hopes that this policy will increase the representation of ERGB students.

- Randomly selecting the class, but reshuffling and re-picking if a given randomly selected class does not have a sufficiently large number of ERGB students.

Advise the dean as to whether any of these policies, or any other policies which you may come up with, are constitutionally permissible.
