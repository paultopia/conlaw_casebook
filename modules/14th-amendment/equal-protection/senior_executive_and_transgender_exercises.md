### Exercise: Senior Executive Service

The President of the United States has issued the following executive order:

> In the judgment of the President, pernicious gender-based socialization processes have impaired the capacity of the executive branch to function most effectively. Men, who are typically socialized from a very young age in our culture to be more confident and outgoing, tend to be promoted beyond their actual talents over women, who are typically socialized from a young age to be more humble and modest. Moreover, women have typically been socialized to display a more empathetic leadership style, which has been shown to be the most productive in high-level executive positions.

> Accordingly, all executive departments are instructed to prefer women for all roles in the Senior Executive Service [the federal classification for the highest-level civil service appointments]. In situation where the evaluation criteria for a position uses numerical scores, women are to be preferred to a degree equivalent to ten points on a scale of 100. In a situation where the evaluation criteria for a position are more subjective, where otherwise equally qualified men and women are available, selection must be made from the available women.

A man who was rejected from a position in the Senior Executive Service in favor of a woman has filed suit, challenging this order under the Equal Protection Clause. As usual, you're a clerk to the judge in whose lap this case has fallen. Your judge has asked you to evaluate this claim, and also to answer the following additional questions:

1. Does your evaluation depend on whether the position in question was based on numerical scores or subjective evaluation?

2. Does your evaluation depend on whether or not the executive order includes credible references to the sociological, psychological, and/or gender studies literature substantiating its claims about socialization?

3. If the policy is unconstitutional, what could the President do to achieve the same goals in a constitutionally permissible way?

### Exercise: Transgender hair

Patricia Plaintiff, a transgender individual who was born with male physical features but who holds a female gender identity, has joined the Goldacre National Guard. The Guard has no gender-based regulations on hair length, however, it is customary for female recruits to wear their hair somewhat longer than male recruits, within the overall limitations provided by regulation. In boot camp, Patricia wore her hair at a customary female, rather than male, length.

Her boot camp commander, in response to this choice of hair lengths, subjected Patricia to verbal disparagement and a variety of informal sanctions, and ultimately to a less desirable unit assignment that she otherwise would have qualified for upon graduation from boot camp. At the unit to which she is assigned, Patricia is ordered to live in the men's barracks, over her objections.

Unsurprisingly, Patricia has brought suit, seeking assignment to the more desirable unit and to a woman's barracks on an Equal Protection theory. You are the clerk to the trial judge. Assuming that the court has jurisdiction over these decisions, and that they give rise to a right of action for injunctive relief (in particular, assume that the military context does not compromise the court's jurisdiction or remedial power), advise your judge on the standard under which Patricia's claims are to be considered, and the result that ought to be reached.
