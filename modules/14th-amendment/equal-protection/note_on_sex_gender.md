### Note on Sex/Gender Discrimination

Now we're moving to our second broad Equal Protection topic, intermediate scrutiny and sex and gender classifications. This is actually going to run a lot shorter than our first topic, but not because it's less important. Rather, it will run shorter because the basic logical structure is the same, only the details of the standard differ (intermediate scrutiny rather than strict scrutiny), and there are some new questions that are hard to answer. But most of your understanding of race cases can transpose directly to sex and gender cases.

Incidentally, in this section, I say "sex/gender" classifications, and otherwise use them interchangeably, but theorists who study the subject usually say that "sex" refers to a biological classification, and "gender" to a social role, and that they come apart. As discussed further below, the main cases universally have concerned discrimination between cisgendered men and cisgendered women; we haven't really been given much guidance about whether the relevant classification really is biological sex, gender, or something in between.

Incidentally, intermediate scrutiny also applies to government action on the basis of "legitimacy," that is, whether someone's parents were married. But this is pretty rare in 2019.

**Applying Intermediate Scrutiny**

Effectively, the analysis for intermediate scrutiny is the same as for strict scrutiny, except that the government need not have a "compelling" state interest; an "important one" will suffice. Furthermore, the relationship between the government interest and the classification need not be "narrowly tailored," but must merely be "substantially related."

It's notoriously unclear whether this distinction makes a difference. As we'll see, the dissent in United States v. Virginia, the leading case on intermediate scrutiny, accuses the Court of applying strict scrutiny in intermediate scrutiny's clothing. 

With respect to substantial relatedness, we often say that the classification can be a little overinclusive or underinclusive. Another way to think about substantial relatedness is that the government doesn't have to do as little gender classification as humanly possible the way it would with race. But its gender classification does still have to be pretty important for the goals it's pursuing. 

So... that's a bit ambiguous, and we just have to live with that. I will not be able to give you a clear answer as to what kinds of fact patterns might survive intermediate scrutiny but not strict scrutiny.

There are some interesting refinements that we'll see when we look at United States v. Virginia, mainly related to the question of whether the government can rely on statistical generalizations about men and women. Other than that, since we're doing sex/gender quickly in this course, it behooves me to point you to the other important cases cases that people tend to assign when it gets longer treatment:

- *Nguyen v. Ins*, 533 U.S. 53 (2001) (additional proof of parentage requirements for citizenship of U.S. citizen father rather than U.S. citizen mother passes intermediate scrutiny) (see also Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347 (1979) for similar rule upheld re: wrongful death suits).

- *Rostker v. Goldberg*, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) (a really weird case: exempting women from the draft permissible because women were excluded from combat---the government's own prior discrimination was given as the substantial interest for the government's discrimination).

- *Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney*, 442 U.S. 256 (1979) (Washington v. Davis, but for sex).

- *Frontiero v. Richardson*, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (plurality flirts with strict scrutiny, strikes down gender-based distinction in military spousal dependent benefits---also we get to see Potter Stewart singlehandedly messing up equal protection law by concurring without an opinion rather than giving the plurality a majority---had he signed on, we might have strict scrutiny today).

- *Reed v. Reed*, 404 U.S. 71 (1971) (law preferring men to women as probate administrators unanimously struck down). 

**Intermediate Scrutiny and Remedial Purposes**

 It turns out that the government may be allowed to be more solicitous of the subordinated when it comes to gender than when it comes to race. That is, broad social remedial purposes are, supposedly, permissible under intermediate scrutiny, but not strict scrutiny: the government can take the initiative to remedy social gender-based injustice.^[I say "supposedly" here because these are fairly old cases, and I think we have some reason to suspect that they wouldn't be followed under the current Court.] Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in *Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan*, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), discusses this at length, although doesn't apply it; earlier cases that did apply it, and which O'Connor cites, include *Califano v. Webster*, 430 U.S. 313 (1977), and *Schlesinger v. Ballard*, 419 U.S. 498 (1975). It's easiest just to quote Justice O'Connor directly:

> It is readily apparent that a State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification. We considered such a situation in Califano v. Webster,  which involved a challenge to a statutory classification that allowed women to eliminate more low-earning years than men for purposes of computing Social Security retirement benefits. Although the effect of the classification was to allow women higher monthly benefits than were available to men with the same earning history, we upheld the statutory scheme, noting that it took into account that women "as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men" and "work[ed] directly to remedy" the resulting economic disparity. 

> A similar pattern of discrimination against women influenced our decision in Schlesinger v. Ballard. There, we considered a federal statute that granted female Naval officers a 13-year tenure of commissioned service before mandatory discharge, but accorded male officers only a 9-year tenure. We recognized that, because women were barred from combat duty, they had had fewer opportunities for promotion than had their male counterparts. By allowing women an additional four years to reach a particular rank before subjecting them to mandatory discharge, the statute directly compensated for other statutory barriers to advancement.

But we know from, e.g., *Parents Involved* (which we discussed, but didn't read), that this isn't permissible in the case of race.  

You may notice that seems kind of perverse:  Remedying social injustice against racial minorities isn't a compelling interest, but remedying social injustice against women is an important interest---and so because intermediate scrutiny is more lenient than strict scrutiny, the government can do more to protect disadvantaged groups with respect to sex than with respect to race! 

To be clear: the apparent perversity follows from the fact that this outcome seems to fly in the face of the original purpose as well as key normative meaning of the Reconstruction amendments.  The 14th Amendment is supposed, if we're originalist at all, to provide the strongest protection to that racially defined class of people who have been victimized by the legacy of slavery. So if the levels of scrutiny framework means that it forbids government action to actually make up for some of the wrongs committed against that group, while permitting the government to make up for wrongs committed against another group who were not intended to be the original beneficiaries of the amendment's protection, that seems ludicrous.

Here's an argument to potentially justify this difference.  I don't necessarily endorse it, but it's worth considering: the cases striking down remedial purposes tend to mostly strike down state action; the cases upholding remedial purposes tend to mostly uphold federal action.  Thus, an alternative way to read these cases, although one that requires being a little aggressive in one's interpretation of the corpus, is to say that the federal government just has broader remedial power over social injustice than the states do, because a) the enforcement clauses of the Reconstruction amendments grant Congress explicit remedial powers plus because b) after all, the whole point of them was as part and parcel of a federal effort to remedy state discrimination and regularize the status of an egregiously oppressed group of people, and c) let's not forget that the Equal Protection Clause, technically speaking, doesn't even apply to the federal government: it was reverse-incorporated through the 5th Amendment's due process clause in Bolling v. Sharpe, but it doesn't have to be the case that the standards are exactly the same. 

Anyway, one occasionally hears arguments along these lines. Like I said, you don't have to buy that justification, but you should know that it exists.

**Why intermediate scrutiny?**

In view of the fact that there has been a massive history of discrimination against women, why not just apply strict scrutiny to sex/gender classifiations?  A number of possible justifications come to mind:

- Originalism: the 14th amendment was actually aimed at race, so it ought to have the strictest standard. Potential counterargument: we apply strict scrutiny to categories other than race, most notably alienage. See generally *Bernal v. Fainter*, 467 U.S. 216 (1984).

- Carolene Products: although there's a history of official discrimination against women as well as lots of present social discrimination, women at least in principle are less politically vulnerable than racial minorities, since, after all, women make up a numerical majority of the population. So the need for constitutional protection is perhaps somewhat lesser.

- Historical: Congress tried to enact an equal rights amendment specifically providing for equal rights for women. It didn't get ratified by enough states. Arguably, that failure makes it less democratically legitimate to turn around and apply strict scrutiny to sex/gender classifications.

- Pragmatic: there are some actual meaningful biological differences that more-or-less track sex lines (like reproductive role, obviously); the same cannot be said for race, according to most credible scientists. So maybe that justifies being a little less cautious about sex classifications ---although the answer to this justification might be "well, that doesn't preclude strict scrutiny, because consideration of biological differences could come in on the narrow tailoring prong."

**What counts as sex/gender discrimination?**

Because lots of other characteristics are linked to sex and gender, it is not always obvious what sorts of things constitute sex/gender discrimination.  In particular, here are three things that might count, but do not do so (yet?) under current doctrine:

- *Sexual orientation*.  You might argue that sexual orientation discrimination is just a form of discrimination based on the relationship between a person's sex/gender and the sex/gender of their preferred partner(s). For some reason, however, the Court has never held this.^[In a Title VII case, Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services Inc., 523 US 75 (1998), the Supreme Court unanimously held that same-sex sexual harassment counted as actionable discrimination "because of sex." (I mean, obviously, right?) The logic of that case would seem to suggest that governmental discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation would also be "because of sex," but, for some reason, it hasn't gone there.]

- *Gender identity*. As noted above, most thoughtful people distinguish between sex, qua biological category, and "gender," qua social category. But because the key precedents in this area of law were developed before a widespread recognition of this distinction, and involved distinction between cisgendered categories, the Supreme Court hasn't yet directly wrestled with the sex/gender distinction, nor considered a transgender discrimination case. Some lower courts have held that transgender discrimination is sex discrimination. See, e.g., *Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312 (11th Cir. 2011) (ruling in favor of state legislative employee fired for transgender status on theory that transgender discrimination is subject to intermediate scrutiny as sex discrimination); *Smith v. City of Salem, Ohio*, 378 F.3d 566 (6th Cir., 2004) (transgendered firefighter suspended from public employment stated claims for violation of Title VII and Equal Protection Clause on the basis of sex discrimination). However, other lower courts have declined to do so. See, e.g., *Etsitty v. Utah Transit Authority*, 502 F.3d 1215 (10th Cir., 2007).

- *Pregnancy*.  You might think that since only women can become pregnant, and sex difference is (arguably) defined by biological reproductive role, discrimination against the pregnant constitutes discrimination against women.  Well... I've got some bad news for you. In *Geduldig v. Aiello*, 417 U.S. 484 (1974), the Court held that pregnancy discrimination was not the same as sex discrimination, and hence not subject to any kind of heightened scrutiny.

*Geduldig* is worth exploring a little bit further. The case arose in the context of California's disability insurance system for employees who were temporarily disabled from working. The insurance benefits excluded "disability resulting from an individual’s court commitment as a dipsomaniac, drug addict, or sexual psychopath," as well as "normal pregnancies" (as opposed to, for example, unusually injurious pregnancies).

You might think that since only women can get pregnant, excluding pregnancy amounts to discriminating on the basis of sex. Sure, there's a sense in which pregnancy-related disability is voluntary, since it's the result of the person's own choices---but so are lots of other disabilities that would be covered by the insurance. If an extreme sports afficionado gets temporarily disabled because of a parkour/base jumping injury, for example, they'd get covered. Excluding pregnancy but not parkour injuries amounts to singling out a "voluntary disability" that only women suffer from.

But the Court said that this wasn't sex discrimination.  Here are the relevant parts of the opinion:

> The program does not discriminate with respect to the persons or groups eligible for its protection, and there is no evidence that it discriminates against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived from the program.

> The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is thus a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, and Frontiero v. Richardson, involving discrimination based upon gender as such. The California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender, but merely removes one physical condition -- pregnancy -- from the list of compensable disabilities. While it is true that only women can become pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification like those considered in Reed and Frontiero. Normal pregnancy is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics. Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical condition.

> The lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups -- pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.

> Indeed, the appellant submitted to the District Court data that indicated that both the annual claim rate and the annual claim cost are greater for women than for men. As the District Court acknowledged, "women contribute about 28 percent of the total disability insurance fund and receive back about 38 percent of the fund in benefits."  Several amici curiae have represented to the Court that they have had a similar experience under private disability insurance programs.

Under the rational basis test, California's decision clearly passes muster, as the Court notes. The budget was just about balanced, and, obviously, lots of people miss work for pregnancies: to require California to cover loss of work for pregnancy would have either totally busted the budget or required a large (and regressive) raise in premiums paid by employees for the program, and defeat the state's goals.

Is the Court here perhaps operating under a Washington v. Davis kind of intuition: this is really just a kind of disparate impact?  But, if so, is that idea fundamentally silly?  It's not incidental that excluding pregnancy only has an impact on women, it's built directly into the nature of exclusion: the capacity to become pregnant is part of the concept of human femaleness. It's not facially neutral?

Suppose we changed the facts a bit. For example, suppose the stage forbids pregnant women from working certain jobs deemed dangerous to the fetus. In this hypo, there isn't a sex-neutral financial benefit, as was present in *Geduldig* ("actuarial benefit", i.e., that the premium for women, like for men, was lower because of the exclusion of pregnancy).  Would that be enough to distinguish *Geduldig*?  More generally, do laws regulating the behavior of pregnant women seem like sex discrimination to you?  Or would it be better to analyze them under a fundamental rights framework, e.g., as burdens on reproductive liberty/privacy?
