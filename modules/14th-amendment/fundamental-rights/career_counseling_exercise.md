### Exercise: Career Counseling

The state of Goldacre enacts the following law:

> (a) It is the conclusion of the Goldacre Legislature that young Goldacreians are choosing, because of ignorance and economic over-optimism, to start their careers in low-paying rather than high-paying employment. Research suggests that a citizen's lifetime earning potential is strongly linked to his or her first full-time job after concluding his or her formal education. Goldacreians who choose to begin their careers in low-paying employment ultimately contribute less to the state's economy and are at greater risk of receiving public benefits later in their careers.

> (b) Accordingly, no resident of Goldacre under the age of thirty (covered resident) may, after completing his or her formal education, take employment at a salary at or below the 25th percentile of the salaries for that resident's age, educational background, and locality (sub-25 position), unless she or he can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a licensed career counselor (LCC), that she or he cannot obtain a higher-paying position. If a LCC denies any such covered resident permission to take a sub-25 position, the covered resident may appeal the LCC's decision to an ordinary trial court, which may review the LCC's factual determinations with respect to the covered resident's inability to find higher-paying work. In the event of such an appeal, the covered resident may nonetheless take such a position until such time as the judicial process is fully completed.

> (c) The Goldacre State Board of Career Counselor Licensing is hereby created in order to examine and certify the LCCs required to provide the services specified in section (b) of this statute. The Board shall establish, by regulation, licensure standards for LCCs as well as rules regarding the rates they may charge, continuing education requirements, and other suitable regulations. In no event shall the board permit a LCC to offer his or services at a rate less than $100 per hour. The board shall issue an initial license to all current members of the Goldacre Association of Career Counselors, Inc.


- Given current doctrine, under what standard will this law be evaluated?

- What result on that standard?

- As a matter of policy, is this the right result?

- If not, what should the law do about it, if anything?

Your group should write down an answer to each of those questions, as well as a brief explanation of your position.
