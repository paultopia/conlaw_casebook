### Note on Fundamental Rights

***What's a fundamental right?**

Doctrinally, we say that a fundamental right is a constitutional individual right, and that if the state infringes on a fundamental right, it gets strict scrutiny.  (More on this below.)  Usually we say the fundamental rights are the enumerated rights, all that stuff in the bill of rights about speech and religion and all that good stuff, plus a collection of unenumerated rights that the Court has, over time, found to be particularly important. But, as you will see, this is a very contested conception.

More or less, the big five unenumerated fundamental rights are: 

- "Privacy," about which which much more in the coming days;

- Marriage, which is closely connected to privacy, and the two together to sexual liberty, etc.; 

- Access to judicial process/the courts; 

- Interstate travel; and

-  Voting.^[Although, really, in light of the 15, 19, and 26th amendments, it's a little weird to call voting unenumerated; in light of the actual due process clause it's a little weird to call access to the courts unenumerated too, but there we go.] 

You could probably slip some parental stuff in there too if you really wanted, see discussion and citation of leading cases in the main opinion in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000).

A helpful way to think about this is as two separate clusters of rights, the "democratic citizen of the union" sorts of rights (voting, suing, moving from state to state) and the "personal and family" sorts of rights (marrying, intimate privacy, childrearing).

So say the state infringes the right to vote. "Nobody in New York may vote unless they can do at least ten pushups." In view of its infringement of the right to vote alone, the law gets strict scrutiny, and, in this case, obviously gets struck down if not actually laughed out of court.

**Discovering new unenumerated fundamental rights**

How does the court decide what's a fundamental right? Suppose you want to convince them to declare a new fundamental right? Well, there isn't a formula, but the key ideas are tradition and importance. 

First, tradition. If something has long been understood as a fundamental right associated with our constitutional tradition, then the Court might understand it as, in essence, a pre-constitutional right, as something that was presupposed by the Constitution--in a bit, I'll talk about the 9th amendment, which arguably provides the textual basis for this idea.

Second, importance. If it looks like the right is sort of basic to living as a person in our society, to functioning as a social/economic/political actor, to enjoy the other rights, to participate as a democratic citizen, then the Court might understand it as a fundamental right too. Another word for this might be "centrality": if it looks like upholding the right is closely interconnected with people's practical ability to exercise other rights, or built into a dense network of laws, this can weigh in favor of it counting as a fundamental right.

Sometimes the existing consensus of the states or more-or-less-relative consensus of the states is taken into account too, particularly in conjunction with development of the law over time: if 49 of 50 states have moved to protect some right, there's some chance that a lawyer will be able to convince the Court to impose it on the 50th as a fundamental right.

Unsurprisingly, however, it's very rare that the Court discovers a new fundamental right, partly because of separation of powers concerns and federalism concerns: to find a fundamental right is, in essence, to take an area of policy away from the states and Congress and hand it over to judges; the Court is naturally quite suspicious of that move.

The most important and full recent discussion of the method for deciding on fundamental rights is *Washington v. Glucksberg*, which we will read shortly.

**Fundamental Rights and Incorporation**

As you saw when you read the incorporation material, "fundamental rights" is also used as a term for the set of rights that the Court is willing to incorporate against the states via the Due Process Clause. The relationship between those two invocations of the term isn't totally clear. Toward the end of this module, we'll explore this relationship at some length via **McDonald v. Chicago**. But, more or less, one argument that has been made, particularly by Justices Harlan and Stevens (you saw a bit of this in Duncan v. Louisiana), is that the 14th Amendment doesn't incorporate any of the Bill of Rights against the states, it just requires states to respect rights that are "fundamental," and those fundamental rights might be enumerated or unenumerated (and if enumerated, don't need to coincide exactly with the stuff that was written down).  However, even justices who quite clearly reject the Harlan/Stevens view often invoke the term "fundamental" to describe incorporated rights, even if they reject the notion of unenumerated substantive due process rights.  So don't confuse these two uses of the terms "fundamental rights." Maybe they mean the same thing, maybe they don't, it depends on the justice. 

**Is There a Textual Justification for Unenumerated Funamental Rights??**

We know where we get the enumerated rights from: they're enumerated. No unreasonable searches, no laws infringing free speech, all that good stuff. But what about the rest, the privacy and the interstate travel and all those?

The conventional claim is that there exists a thing called "substantive due process."  Remember that "procedural due process," which we started with, is all about figuring out whether the government followed fair procedures, "substantive due process" is about protecting unenumerated fundamental rights. But they both come from the due process clause. 

Here's a quick capsule summary of some of the history, which we'll be talking about more over the next few weeks. According to conventional wisdom, in the Bad Old Lochner Days (TM), the Supreme Court struck down most of the New Deal on a fundamental rights theory, primarily based on ideas like liberty of contract. The world almost ended, but then FDR managed to bully them into submission and got Lochner overruled. Thereafter, "substantive due process" became kind of a dirty word, and to this day we effectively use Lochner as a kind of judicial insult. The court recognizes that it can't just make up rights to keep the legislature from doing public policy, and, particularly, there are no economic fundamental rights. (Hence, ordinary economic legislation just gets rational basis scrutiny, unless it impinges on some other constitutional right, like the First Amendment.) That being said, the Court has again come around to the idea of unenumerated fundamental rights, particularly with respect to privacy. *Griswold v. Connecticut* stands for the resurrection of unenumerated substantive due process rights, transposed from the economic to the personal domain---and, unsurprisingly, conservatives have ever since then accused the Court of reviving Lochnerism. 

One thing many people have observed over the years is that we don't actually need to appeal to the Due Process Clause to provide a Constitutional basis for unenumerated rights. We have a perfectly good Constitutional provision that seems to license Justices to discover unenumerated rights on its own, the 9th Amendment:

> The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

That's the actual bit of the constitution where the framers were, like, "dudes, these ain't the only rights." Arguably, it would have been better if the Court had never gone the Substantive Due process route, but instead held that the 9th Amendment permitted the judiciary to enforce individual fundamental rights, and then held that the Bill of Rights including the 9th Amendment was incorporated via the 14th Amendment's Privileges or Immunities Clause. 

Against the 9th Amendment theory of fundamental rights, we might observe that this amendment is notoriously vague. There are countless arguments about its meaning, with many jurists and scholars arguing that it doesn't refer to individual rights enforceable against the enumerated powers of Congress. (Randy Barnett and Louis Seidman, two Georgetown Constitutional Law professors, [have a helpful summary](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-ix) of the arguments online.) 

That being said, as vague as the 9th Amendment is, it hardly seems like a *worse* basis for the idea of unenumerated rights than the Due Process Clause; it's easy to think that the words, "substantive due process" are an oxymoron. One of the key binary oppositions through which we understand the law is "substance" vs. "process." The rules of civil procedure are process. The rules of tort are substance. The Erie doctrine (remember that?) says that in federal court you do federal procedure and state substance. The framers would have been very unlikely to intend to create substantive rights through the words "due process of law." 

Nonetheless, "substantive due process" is what the Court has given us. And typically, fundamental rights cases revolving around the unenumerated rights unhelpfully elaborate to say that the right in question is part of the "liberty" protected by the 5th and 14th amendments.^[Which, you'll note, is a bit of a non sequitur, since the part that fundamental rights skeptics object to is the "due process" part, not the "liberty" part, i.e., to the proposition that, granting the fundamental right in question belongs in the liberty bucket, the due process clause means anything other than "notice and an opportunity to be heard for individual deprivations, the democratic process for collective deprivations," you know, like we learned in the beginning of the course.] So that is the doctrine we have.

### Note on Levels of Scrutiny

You probably remember the notion of levels of scrutiny from your original Constitutional Law class. But, just in case you're a little rusty, here's a refresher and a little bit of theory.

One useful way to think of a level of scrutiny is a way of expressing an overall balancing test, where what we're balancing is the importance of what the government is trying to achieve by the alleged rights violation or classification (hereafter "government action") and necessity of the government action to the government's ends against the perniciousness of the kind of government action under consideration. Then the choice between the three levels of scrutiny, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or rational basis scrutiny, is the doctrinal way of capturing the individual interest and perniciousness of the kind of government action. Race discrimination is really dangerous and nasty, so we're going to apply strict scrutiny to it; violating a fundamental right like the right to vote, ditto. Regulating commercial speech (i.e., advertisement) under the 1st Amendment is probably less dangerous and nasty than regulating speech for its political content, so it only gets intermediate scrutiny, and so forth.

*Strict Scrutiny* is what the Court applies to fundamental rights violations (at least formally, in name---in practice it often applies something else) and suspect classifications under the Equal Protection Clause. 

When we apply strict scrutiny, we have to ask two questions. First, what's the government interest at stake? To satisfy strict scrutiny, it has to be "compelling." 

How do we know what's a compelling interest? Well, there are some obvious ones --- national security, for example. But beyond that, a compelling interest is kind of what five justices think is a compelling interest---we'll think about this at quite some depth when we get to the Equal Protection section of the course. One important subtlety is that the government doesn't get to make up a compelling interest after the fact: there has to be some reason to think that the compelling interest or interests that justify the government action were actually behind the action in the first place.

Second, is the government action "narrowly tailored" to achieve that compelling interest? Sometimes narrow tailoring is also described as "the least restrictive means," but the two formulations basically mean the same thing: the government action has to be a very close match to the compelling interest. That has two implications: first, the government can't engage in any more rights-impinging or classification than is necessary to serve the compelling interest. If there's a way to achieve the compelling interest without impinging on the given fundamental right or using the suspect classification, or with less impinging on rights or classification, then the government has to take it. Second, the government action has to actually serve the compelling interest. In other words, it has to be effective.

Importantly, the burden is on the government to show all of this. So typically, strict scrutiny means its very probable that the government will lose.

Strict scrutiny applies, as I have said, at least formally to all "fundamental rights," as well as to "suspect classifications" under Equal Protection (which we'll consider down the road---it's mostly race).

*Intermediate Scrutiny*: like strict scrutiny, the burden of proof is on the government, and like strict scrutiny, you can't use after-the-fact invented justifications.

The big difference, however, is in the actual level of scrutiny applied. Where for strict scrutiny, the government needs a compelling interest, in intermediate scrutiny the government merely needs an important interest. And where for strict scrutiny, the government action has to be narrowly tailored to the interest, in intermediate scrutiny the government action must only be substantially related to the interest.

What does that mean in practice? Well, the difference between important interests and compelling interests isn't particularly clear. Every compelling interest presumably is also an important interest, but not every important interest need be a compelling one. But the Court has never given us a list of government interests that are important but not compelling.

For the most part, intermediate scrutiny comes up when we get to sex/gender discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause. It also applies to some First Amendment issues which are beyond the scope of this course. 

*Rational Basis* is the default rule for if we don't have some other level of scrutiny that applies. And rational basis is extremely deferential. The court will uphold a government action under rational basis if it's rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Rational basis is easy. Basically, the government almost always wins. First, the government merely needs a "legitimate" interest, which can be something like administrative convenience or saving a little bit of money.  

Moreover, the burden of proof and treatment of after-acquired (cooked up for litigation) reasons shifts when we get to rational basis. As you know, with both strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny, the government has the burden of showing its challenged conduct meets the given interest, and it cannot rely on interests cooked up after the fact for the purposes of litigation; rather, the interests it appeals to have to be the interests that were actually under consideration (in some meaningful sense, given the well-known problems of aggregated legislative motivations and such) when the legislation was enacted (or policy was chosen, executive action was decided upon, etc.).

Both of those flip with rational basis. Now the party challenging the law has to prove that the government's action isn't rationally related to a legitimate interest, and this can include any interest that can justify the action, regardless of whether it had anything to do with why the government action was enacted in the first place.

So how can the government lose a rational basis case? Well, for the most part, it has to be either acting totally arbitrarily or irrationally,^[See, e.g., the claim at issue in *Village of Willowbrook v. Olech* where a city, allegedly for no reason, demanded a water line easement on plaintiff's property twice as large as everyone else's.] or, arguably, it has to get into a "rational basis with bite" situation, which we'll see with the gay rights cases, where arguably the court accused the government of a kind of animus toward gay people. 

Rational basis is the default rule, in the post-Lochner era, for rights claims that are not classified as fundamental.

**Is strict scrutiny really what we get for fundamental rights?**

Remember how I said that you get strict scrutiny when the government infringes a fundamental right? Well, that's not true. Actually, strict scrutiny is kind of the default invocation, but lots of the time the Court applies lots of different tests. An easy example is in the First Amendment---depending on the kind of speech and the kind of restriction, you might get intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny, or all kinds of other weird stuff. And that's so even though we say that the speech rights enumerated in the First Amendment are fundamental rights within the meaning of this area of jurisprudence. Same goes for abortion: Roe v. Wade articulated a complex test that was kind of derived from strict scrutiny (sorta---we'll talk about it), but then that got changed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to an "undue burden" test that has nothing visible to do with strict scrutiny.

So, again, we recite this formulation, and we test it (and I'm going to test it), "fundamental rights get strict scrutiny," but you really should only understand it as a rough rule of thumb, and be aware that fundamental rights jurisprudence is a lot more complicated. The unenumerated fundamental rights are more consistently strict scrutiny than the enumerated fundamental rights, but even there, there's a lot of wiggle.^[If you're interested in learning more about this, there's a very good article on this subject (and it's only a dozen pages long): Adam Winkler, Fundamentally Wrong about Fundamental Rights, 23 Constitutional Commentary 277 (2006).]

**Is Strict Scrutiny Too Forgiving?**

Another problem with the idea that fundamental rights get strict scrutiny is that means that, in actual practice, the government can infringe them all the time. The First Amendment, even though it is outside the scope of this course, is a good example: there are dozens of situations where the government gets to censor your speech, even though the text of the Constitution reads like a categorical prohibition on censorship. Justice Black had a famous objection to this. From his concurrence in Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147 (1959):

> Certainly the First Amendment's language leaves no room for inference that abridgments of speech and press can be made just because they are slight. That Amendment provides, in simple words, that "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." I read "no law abridging" to mean no law abridging. The First Amendment, which is the supreme law of the land, has thus fixed its own value on freedom of speech and press by putting these freedoms wholly "beyond the reach" of federal power to abridge. No other provision of the Constitution purports to dilute the scope of these unequivocal commands of the First Amendment. Consequently, I do not believe that any federal agencies, including Congress and this Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are "more important interests." The contrary notion is, in my judgment, court-made not Constitution-made.

But if you agree with Justice Black about free speech, might you also agree with him about unenumerated fundamental rights?^[You might disagree with Justice Black about the categorical nature of the rule, however. Arguably, "the freedom of speech" doesn't mean "everything people want to say," but instead refers, e.g., to the traditional scope of what people's freedom was understood to mean at the time of the Framing. It might be that some things, like defamation, weren't understood to be part of "the freedom of speech" even though they are "speech." That is, "the freedom of" might serve as a limiting modifier on "speech."]  If there's a fundamental constitutional right to an abortion, then why is it weighed against the government interests offered as a reason to restrict it? And the same could be said about the Equal Protection Clause: the 14th Amendment demands people be treated equally, but we say that people may be treated unequally if there's a good enough reason---how can we square that with the categorical command of the text? 

This is a question that you should keep in your mind as we go through this material. If there really is a pre-constitutional right to something, then on what basis does Congress or a state legislature deprive an individual of it? What kind of right is it, ultimately, that can be infringed if the government has a really good reason, and why should the standard for really good reason even formally be the same in all these cases (albeit not necessarily actually)?
