### Introductory Note on Procedural Due Process

We begin with the most fundamental doctrine in all of American law: Procedural Due Process. Every government ruled under law has something like a doctrine of Procedural Due Process, because that's the rule that requires that when the government uses its awesome power against someone, it does so only via the operation of law (as opposed to the arbitrary will of the powerful).

Our idea of Procedural Due Process is a direct descendant of the protections imposed on the English Crown by Magna Carta, in relevant part: 

> NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.

Our Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are briefer:

> “No person shall be… deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]” 

> [N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law[.]

This is about as straightforward a legal rule as you can get.  You can't be shot, locked up, or have your stuff taken without due process. Of course, there is no such thing as a straightforward legal rule, so there are many questions we might want to ask about this. Consider the following.

- Who is a person?

- Who are the actors whose behavior this clause regulates?

- What counts as a deprivation?

- What counts as life, liberty, or property?

- What constitutes due process of law?

The answers to a number of these questions are pretty straightforward. For the most part, a person is a legal person: corporations yes, cats no. (My cat excepted.) Likewise, it's pretty clear that this stuff just applies to the government: to the feds through the Fifth amendment and through the states through the Fourteenth, although we might argue whether the passive voice construction should have meant that it applied to the states from the get-go, or even whether it obligates the government to regulate private violence.

But the last three on this list are less than clear. Let's talk about them.

**What interests?**

First, what interests are protected? The Constitution says "life, liberty, or property." We kind of know what life and liberty are. But property? We think we know what that means. You took a class in 1L year, you got the notions of real property, and bundles of rights, and chattel---these are the kinds of things that make up property.

But what about stuff that the government has promised to give you in the future? Well, in Goldberg v. Kelly, the Court held that this can be a property right too. The idea is that the recipient has a statutory entitlement to the benefits. And there were determinate statutory standards for who was entitled to receive the benefits. So it looks a lot like a property right---a legal rule saying that persons who meet the following conditions X Y and Z are entitled to get A B and C.

>Appellant does not contend that procedural due process is not applicable to the termination of welfare benefits. Such benefits are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them. Their termination involves state action that adjudicates important rights. The constitutional challenge cannot be answered by an argument that public assistance benefits are ”a ‘privilege,' and not a 'right." Relevant constitutional restraints apply as much to the withdrawal of public assistance benefits as to disqualification for unemployment compensation, or to denial of a tax exemption, or to discharge from public employment.

So let's think about a hypo for this. Before class, I want you to come up with an answer to the question: If you go to a state college, what happens if the professor promises you a passing grade in this class, in exchange for your consistent attendance? Do you have a property interest in that?

What if the professor writes it in the syllabus? “everyone who shows up to every class will pass?” 

What if it’s part of official university policy? 

What if the professor makes it into a contract? It looks like it’s supported by consideration... She wants you to show up to class, you want a passing grade... (Are contract rights against the government and Procedural Due Process rights complements or substitutes?)

If you don't have a property interest in your grades, what about in your status as a student? If the professor accuses you of cheating on an exam, does she have to give you some kind of process before trying to expel you? Does it depend on the content of a written policy from the university?

Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), gives some insight on these questions. In that case, the Court held that a state university professor could have a property interest in his job, although he didn't have one in that case. And then later, in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the Court found one in the job of a school security guard.

Here's what the court said in Roth:

> To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.

So what do we get out of this? Number one, a property interest is created by some external law, like state law. You have a property interest only if the state says you're entitled to something. 

Number two, it has to be important. You don't get due process if your state employer says that you have to take your lunch break at 12:30 instead of noon. 

Number three, it kind of has to look like an entitlement, the kind of thing that you can justifiably rely on being provided under the substantive law in question.^[Thus, the key difference between the professor in Board of Regents v. Roth and the security guard in Loudermill is that the professor was on a year-to-year contract which made clear that there wasn't a right of renewal, while the security guard was in a protected civil service provision which was only terminable, under state law, for cause.] And you can usually tell that this is the case more or less by the extent to which the law conditions eligibility for the entitlement on specific facts or rules and operates more or less mechanically rather than by some kind of discretionary policy decision. (Another way to think about this is as the difference between a vested right and a mere expectancy.)

And this is important: once an interest is created by state law, the procedures provided in state law do not control the process that is due. What controls is the constitution, which establishes whether or not the procedures provided for by the state are sufficient.^[Early on, the government often tried a defense that became known as "the bitter with the sweet." The idea there was that the procedures the state provided were not separable from the property interest it created, so if someone wanted to accept, e.g., the welfare benefits, they must also accept the state-provided procedure that accompanied them. The Court rejected the "bitter with the sweet" defense.] 

**Property interests: summarized:**

1. Created by state law.

2. But once found, state law procedures do not control, how much process is due, constitution does. 

3. Must be an important interest. 

4. Must be an "entitlement” --- and we look for a justifiable reliance/expectation, and a test for eligibility that relies on specific fact-finding rather than open-ended policy decision. 

**How much process is "due?"**

There are lots of different kinds of legal process someone could get before the government deprives them of a life, liberty, or property interest. Let's think about some questions: 

- Do you get a hearing before or after deprivation? (often the key issue) 

- Do you get a lawyer? If so, is that lawyer to be paid for by the government? 

- Do you get to call witnesses? If so, do you get compulsory process to get them (i.e., subpoenas)? 

- Do you get to seek discovery from the government? 

- Do you have a right to confront witnesses against you (like via cross-examination)?

- Do you have a right to a judicial officer who is independent of the agency that's making an adverse decision?  Access to a formal court?  

- Do you have a right to an appeal?

In the criminal law, we have a full adversary process with extensive procedural protections for the defendant, and it has to happen before the defendant is deprived of liberty for an extended period of time---that's what the speedy trial right does, forbids the government from taking away people's liberty to a large degree before a hearing. Criminal defendants get a privilege against self-incrimination, a government provided lawyer, a right to confrontation, all kinds of things like that.

By contrast, here's all the court said about the process to be provided to a fired government employee before firing in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 US 532 (1985):

> The essential requirements of due process, and all that respondents seek or the Court of Appeals required, are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement. The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.

However, the court also made clear that the reason so little process was provided pre-termination was because the employee was also provided with a full hearing after the fact, that is, he could get his job restored ex post. This question of pre-termination vs post-termination process is often the key issue in procedural due process cases.

There should be an intuitive reason for this difference. Losing your job is bad. But if you get sent to prison, not only do you lose your job, but you also get locked in a cage for years. It's a much worse deprivation, and so obviously, the government ought to have to jump through more hoops in order to inflict it on you---just so long as those extra hoops are effective in keeping the government from erroneously convicting someone.  (The point of additional procedural protections is always to improve the accuracy of the decision.)

In *Matthews v. Eldridge* the Court laid out the canonical three-part balancing test that captures the intuition just described.  The test has been criticized for being so abstract that it doesn't really give courts lots of guidance, but, in its defense, it at least forces courts and litigants to make arguments in sensible terms. 

The three parts are:

1.  The weight of the private interest at stake. A person who is deprived of welfare benefits could end up sleeping on the street or struggling to get food---this is a very significant interest, and there probably ought to be more process before the state deprives someone of that property interest. By contrast, we might imagine, say, if the state seizes your luggage at the airport there's a much smaller private interest at stake. It just doesn't matter so much if the government unjustly seizes your luggage (the airline was probably going to lose it anyway). 

2. The risk of erroneous deprivation. This is a factor that makes the most sense when it's judged against the existing process that the state has provided---remember that Procedural Due Process cases come up when someone challenges an existing procedure. And it can be broken down into two sub-factors. There's the reliability of existing procedures---are they fair? Do they do a pretty good job of getting the right answer? And then there's the marginal benefit of additional procedures---is there something that the government could do which would make the process much more reliable or fair?

3.  The government's interest in avoiding additional process. Sometimes the government interest will be purely administrative: extra process costs money and creates an administrative burden, the government has a legitimate interest in keeping its budget down and its bureaucracy as un-cumbersome as possible. However, sometimes the government will also have additional interests in avoiding process. If, for example, there's a military or law enforcement emergency, sometimes the government has a reason to act quickly, and the government has a strong interest in avoiding the delay that would be incurred if it had to provide pre-termination process.

**What counts as a deprivation?**

Doesn't everything the government does deprive someone of something? After all, when they pass a law that says "no driving over sixty-five," that deprives me of the liberty to go really fast. When they impose income taxes, they deprive all of us of property. When the city demands that homeowners get a permit before building a shed on their land, it arguably deprives homeowners of both liberty and property. Does everyone get a hearing in all of these cases?

A good example to ponder in order to work through this question is: how come I don't get a hearing before the IRS makes the University take a third of my salary out of my paycheck every month? We will see that the key reason revolves around the difference between individualized action and a general law, applicable to the whole community. And we will also see that this distinction tracks a more basic difference between legislation and judicial/executive action.

**An algorithm for PDP problems**

STEP 1: Is plaintiff challenging individualized state action?

If YES, proceed to step 2.

If NO, stop here, there's no procedural due process claim.

STEP 2: Does plaintiff have a life, liberty, or property interest?

If YES, proceed to step 3.

If NO, stop here, there's no procedural due process claim.

UNSURE? Here are some rules of thumb:

- Has the state created an entitlement?

- Do people rely on it?  

- Is there an important interest at play?

- Is it the sort of issuewhere the government decision could be right or wrong?

STEP 3: Apply *Matthews* balancing

- How important is the individual interest?

- What’s the government interest in avoiding more process? 

- Would additional process make the government decision more accurate?
