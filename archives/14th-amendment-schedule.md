You'll observe that there's no reading on November 26.  In order to facilitate your being able to process the material you've learned over the holiday, November 26 will be a review session; however, it's still an official class day and attendance is expected. 

You'll also observe that the weeks are a little bit uneven, and the schedule is weighted toward the beginning and middle of the term.  This is by design: I expect us to fall a little bit behind as the semester goes on, and later weeks will be spent partially synthesizing what we have learned in prior weeks in addition to new reading.^[Plus, I know how hectic things get toward the end of the semester. Finally, toward the end of the semester, I may also add some lower court materials for cases currently pending before the Supreme Court, depending on time and student interest.] What this means for your practical life-planning is that it may be advisable to read ahead for particularly heavy weeks.  You'll note, for example, that week 8, which is the heaviest week of reading, follows a week in which we have an unusually light load and only one day of class---I strongly recommend starting your week 8 reading in week 7.
