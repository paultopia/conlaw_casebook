# South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987)

**Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.**


Petitioner South Dakota permits persons 19 years of age or older to purchase
beer containing up to 3.2% alcohol.  In
1984 Congress enacted 23 U.S.C. § 158, which directs the
Secretary of Transportation to withhold a percentage of federal highway funds
otherwise allocable from States "in which the purchase or public possession .
. . of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than twenty-one years of
age is lawful." The State sued in United States District Court seeking a
declaratory judgment that § 158 violates the constitutional limitations on
congressional exercise of the spending power.


The Constitution empowers Congress to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts,
and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general
Welfare of the United States." Incident to this power,
Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of federal funds, and has
repeatedly employed the power "to further broad policy objectives by
conditioning receipt of federal moneys upon compliance by the recipient with
federal statutory and administrative directives." The breadth of this power was made clear in United States v. Butler (1936), where the Court,
resolving a longstanding debate over the scope of the Spending Clause,
determined that "the power of Congress to authorize expenditure of public
moneys for public purposes is not limited by the direct grants of legislative
power found in the Constitution." Thus, objectives not thought to be within
Article I's "enumerated legislative fields" may nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending power and the
conditional grant of federal funds.


The spending power is of course not unlimited, but is instead subject to several general restrictions
articulated in our cases. The first of these limitations is derived from the
language of the Constitution itself: the exercise of the spending power must
be in pursuit of "the general welfare." In considering whether a particular
expenditure is intended to serve general public purposes, courts should defer
substantially to the judgment of Congress. Second, we have required that if Congress
desires to condition the States' receipt of federal funds, it "must do so
unambiguously . . ., enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly,
cognizant of the consequences of their participation." Third, our cases
have suggested (without significant elaboration) that conditions on federal
grants might be illegitimate if they are unrelated "to the federal interest in
particular national projects or programs."  See also Ivanhoe Irrigation Dist. v. McCracken ("[T]he Federal Government may establish and impose
reasonable conditions relevant to federal interest in the project and to the
over-all objectives thereof"). Finally, we have noted that other
constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional
grant of federal funds. 

South Dakota does not seriously claim that § 158 is inconsistent with any of
the first three restrictions mentioned above. We can readily conclude that the
provision is designed to serve the general welfare, especially in light of the
fact that "the concept of welfare or the opposite is shaped by Congress. . .
." Congress found that the differing drinking ages in the States created particular incentives for
young persons to combine their desire to drink with their ability to drive,
and that this interstate problem required a national solution. The means it
chose to address this dangerous situation were reasonably calculated to
advance the general welfare. The conditions upon which States receive the
funds, moreover, could not be more clearly stated by Congress.  And the State itself, rather than challenging the
germaneness of the condition to federal purposes, admits that it "has never
contended that the congressional action was . . . unrelated to a national
concern in the absence of the Twenty-first Amendment."  Indeed, the condition imposed by Congress is directly related to one of
the main purposes for which highway funds are expended--safe interstate
travel. This goal of the interstate highway system
had been frustrated by varying drinking ages among the States. A Presidential
commission appointed to study alcohol-related accidents and fatalities on the
Nation's highways concluded that the lack of uniformity in the States'
drinking ages created "an incentive to drink and drive" because "young persons
commut[e] to border States where the drinking age is lower." By enacting § 158,
Congress conditioned the receipt of federal funds in a way reasonably
calculated to address this particular impediment to a purpose for which the
funds are expended.

The remaining question about the validity of § 158--and the basic point of
disagreement between the parties--is whether the Twenty-first Amendment
constitutes an "independent constitutional bar" to the conditional grant of
federal funds. Petitioner, relying on its view that the
Twenty-first Amendment prohibits direct regulation of drinking ages by
Congress, asserts that "Congress may not use the spending power to regulate
that which it is prohibited from regulating directly under the Twenty-first
Amendment." But our cases show that this
"independent constitutional bar" limitation on the spending power is not of
the kind petitioner suggests. United States v. Butler, for example, established that the constitutional
limitations on Congress when exercising its spending power are less exacting
than those on its authority to regulate directly.


We have also held that a perceived Tenth Amendment limitation on congressional
regulation of state affairs did not concomitantly limit the range of
conditions legitimately placed on federal grants. In _Oklahoma v. Civil
Service Comm'n, the Court
considered the validity of the Hatch Act insofar as it was applied to
political activities of state officials whose employment was financed in whole
or in part with federal funds. The State contended that an order under this
provision to withhold certain federal funds unless a state official was
removed invaded its sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment. Though
finding that "the United States is not concerned with, and has no power to
regulate, local political activities as such of state officials," the Court
nevertheless held that the Federal Government "does have power to fix the
terms upon which its money allotments to states shall be disbursed." The Court found no violation of the State's sovereignty
because the State could, and did, adopt "the 'simple expedient' of not
yielding to what she urges is federal coercion. The offer of benefits to a
state by the United States dependent upon cooperation by the state with
federal plans, assumedly for the general welfare, is not unusual." 

These cases establish that the "independent constitutional bar" limitation on
the spending power is not, as petitioner suggests, a prohibition on the
indirect achievement of objectives which Congress is not empowered to achieve
directly. Instead, we think that the language in our earlier opinions stands
for the unexceptionable proposition that the power may not be used to induce
the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.
Thus, for example, a grant of federal funds conditioned on invidiously
discriminatory state action or the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment
would be an illegitimate exercise of the Congress' broad spending power. But
no such claim can be or is made here. Were South Dakota to succumb to the
blandishments offered by Congress and raise its drinking age to 21, the
State's action in so doing would not violate the constitutional rights of
anyone.

Our decisions have recognized that in some circumstances the financial
inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at
which "pressure turns into compulsion." Here, however, Congress has directed only
that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age lower than 21 lose a
relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds. Petitioner
contends that the coercive nature of this program is evident from the degree
of success it has achieved. We cannot conclude, however, that a conditional
grant of federal money of this sort is unconstitutional simply by reason of
its success in achieving the congressional objective.


When we consider, for a moment, that all South Dakota would lose if she
adheres to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5% of
the funds otherwise obtainable under specified highway grant programs, the
argument as to coercion is shown to be more rhetoric than fact. As we said a
half century ago in Steward Machine Co. v. Davis:

>[E]very rebate from a tax when conditioned upon conduct is in some measure a temptation. But to hold that motive or temptation is equivalent to coercion is to plunge the law in endless difficulties. The outcome of such a doctrine is the acceptance of a philosophical determinism by which choice becomes impossible. Till now the law has been guided by a robust common sense which assumes the freedom of the will as a working hypothesis in the solution of its problems.

Here Congress has offered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact
higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise choose. But the
enactment of such laws remains the prerogative of the States not merely in
theory but in fact. Even if Congress might lack the power to impose a national
minimum drinking age directly, we conclude that encouragement to state action
found in § 158 is a valid use of the spending power. Accordingly, the judgment
of the Court of Appeals is
