# First Amendment: Free Speech

Our class doesn't read any free speech cases. This is purely a time issue: there just isn't the room to cover it, and often it's taught in a separate course altogether. Nonetheless, you ought to have *some* exposure to the doctrine, so I'm just summarizing a few of the major themes here.  

Justice Black had the great line about the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law means Congress shall make no law," and as you know by now, when Justice Black is obviously right that's when he loses. So we have a bunch of rules about when Congress can, in fact, make laws limiting speech. Here, I'm going to bang through them, with the idea that most of it, actually, is fairly straightforward.

As you'll also see, there are a bunch of rules. In fact, I'd go so far as to say there's a never-ending list of doctrinal distinctions. That's another reason I'm not even trying to fit it into the main bit of class. 

## Content-based regulation

Let's start with a baseline rule. Most speech regulations that matter will be **content-based**. By "content-based," we just mean the government's trying to regulate the substance of what people are saying, as opposed to the way they're saying it (for example, a noise regulation isn't content-based, the government isn't regulating what people say, just how loud they say it). 

Content based regulations can generally be divided into two categories, **subject-matter based** ("no talking about abortion") and **viewpoint based** ("no making pro-life arguments"). Both kinds of regulation are bad, presumptively invalid, and actually get **strict scrutiny**. (We've seen this before, right? The First Amendment is a fundamental right! It gets strict scrutiny!) But typically we say viewpoint-based restrictions are worse, somehow. Like, we imagine they get an even stricter kind of strict scrutiny or something.

One important thing you need to understand with content discrimination is that it even can be used to invalidate regulations that otherwise prohibit conduct that the government can in fact prohibit. For example, the law "no graffiti" is totally constitutional. The law "no graffiti in favor of the democratic party" is totally unconstitutional. See the discussion in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377 (1991) (cross-burning conviction under hate speech law invalidated as content-based even though gov't can obviously prohibit burning things on other people's lawns).

There's also one weird glitch in the doctrine according to which facially content-based regulations can be permissible if there's a content-neutral motivation. The Court will sometimes say those regulations are really content-neutral, even though the content is written right into the law. But this basically only applies to dirty movie theatres. I'm serious. The idea is the state can zone porn theatres out of the neighborhood based on the content of the expression in them (i.e., the porn), in order to prevent the crime that they're associated with. Renton v. Playtime Theatres, 475 U.S. 41 (1986).

## Public Forums

We often say those rules apply to the "public forum," but the "public forum" basically means "only some kinds of government property." So obviously the full protections of the speech clause applies to speech in one's own home as well as out on the sidewalk. But in addition, they also apply in areas, like the sidewalk, that are considered part of the "traditional public forum"---the town square, the steps of City Hall, places where people typically showed up to rant about stuff. 

This is contrasted with kinds of government space that are not public forums. There are also "limited public forums" where the government has opened up the space for a particular category of speaker or subject (e.g., the inside of a university classroom), and there are totally non-public forums (e.g., the inside of a military base). The rules are more permissive in these categories. The doctrine here is a total mess, though, particularly on limited public forums---partly because it's hard to tell the difference between government speech (about which more below) and a limited public forum. The short version is that the government is sometimes allowed to discriminate on the basis of speakers or subjects in limited public forums. Before I came to Northwestern, I was at the University of Iowa---a public university---and I felt totally free to silence people who weren't students, and to tell the people who were students to talk about constitutional law and related subjects rather than the latest episode of the netflix series du jour or something, without worrying about violating the First Amendment. And in non-public forums the government can do what it wants, broadly speaking.

## Time, Place, Manner

In public forums the government can also do reasonable time, place, and manner regulation. This basically means stuff like noise ordinances, keeping the protestors from blocking traffic, etc. The key case is Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989), which held basically that content-neutral time, place and manner regulations get intermediate scrutiny and must leave open alternative channels for communication. The important government interest (for applying intermediate scrutiny) must also be unrelated to the suppression of speech.

N.B. We usually say this is intermediate scrutiny, but the Court actually mixed together intermediate and strict scrutiny talk, saying "narrowly tailored to serve a substantial government interest." But then the Court (this was a Kennedy opinion, what do you expect) elaborated to say that "narrowly tailored" doesn't mean "least restrictive means." (It does mean that in the equal protection/substantive due process context. But not here.) Here's what Kennedy said:

> Lest any confusion on the point remain, we reaffirm today that a regulation of the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government's legitimate, content-neutral interests, but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so. Rather, the requirement of narrow tailoring is satisfied so long as the regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation. To be sure, this standard does not mean that a time, place, or manner regulation may burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests. Government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals. So long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government's interest, however, the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.

So, we kinda read that as intermediate scrutiny, because it's the only way to make sense of it. Like I said, public forum doctrine is a mess.

## Organizing free speech law.

But anyway. Let's get back to the baseline rule: content-based regulation gets strict scrutiny. We've already seen our first two exceptions to "no law means no law": "unless it's in a non-public forum" and "unless it's a content-neutral time place manner regulation." To gather together the rest of the million exceptions, there are two relatively sensible dimensions to organize First Amendment free speech doctrine along. The first is the **kind of speech**. The second is the **kind of regulation**. :

### Kinds of speech

Speech can range from wholly unprotected to more protected, or within the core of protection.

Let's start with unprotected categories of speech. 

#### Obscenity: unprotected.

We have a test, called the Miller test, but it's notoriously difficult to apply. So I'm just going to give you the standard, and then let you take comfort in the fact that this almost never comes up.

The Miller Test: a work is obscene if all of the following are true:

1.  The average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest,

2.  the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law, and 

3.  the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

The government has also occasionally tried to regulate several categories of things that seem kind of close to obscenity. 

"Indecency," which as far as I can tell means "slightly less dirty speech," is usually perfectly constitutionally protected, but the Court has permitted laws regulating it in very specific circumstances when it basically gets transmitted at people, particularly children, and particularly over broadcast. So regulating dirty broadcast radio, OK; regulating dirty internet, not OK. Totally unprincipled doctrine. 

The Court has also rejected attempts to extend the obscenity idea to violent video games, even for children. Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association.

#### Incitement of Illegal Conduct: unprotected

"Hey, guys, let's go burn down that house!  I've got a can of gas right here!" 

The test here is called the Brandenburg Test. Also three parts, also all must be met:

1.  Harm must be imminent. No "let's burn down that house next month, depending on the price of gasoline!"

2.  It must be likely to produce the illegal action. You can't just be some person randomly yelling nonsense, like you stand up in class and say "ok, everybody riot now!" Nobody's going to riot just because you say so.

3.  Finally, the speaker must intend to cause the illegal action.

Be careful to distinguish incitement from sort of general criminal speech. Some kinds of speech are banned under the notion that they're not really speech, they're really conduct, because they're not really being done for their expressive purposes. For example, extortion happens through talking, but it's not really about speech. Nobody's going to raise a First Amendment defense to the blackmail charges.^[Don't think about this too hard, unless you reall want to.  I confess that I'm sometimes tempted by the idea that there could be an argument for counting conventional blackmail of the form "I'll tell your spouse you're cheating on them unless you give me a pile of money" as First Amendment speech. But probably don't try that in court.]

#### Fighting words: unprotected

"Fighting words" are speech likely to provoke a violent response from the audience. The classic case is Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568 (1942), where the defendant had called a police officer a "God-damned racketeer" and a "damned fascist." The Court said that calling someone those things is likely to provoke retaliation, and thus a breach of the peace (note, re: "fascist," that it was 1942---the country was right in the middle of a war with some big 'ole fascists). 

This doctrine is almost never used, it's basically been dead for decades.   Good to know about it though for the bar exam, in case you get a question that involves, I dunno, someone going to the ASPCA and talking about how great kicking puppies is or something. It may also be interesting to think about in the context of the rise of return of highly public and prominent racist movements in the United States and elsewhere: is neo-nazi speech a form of "fighting words?"

#### Commercial Speech: protected, but more weakly than normal

Commercial speech basically means advertising. Regulation of commercial speech, even content-based regulation, gets intermediate scrutiny. Also, the legislature can flat-out prohibit false commercial speech (lying), and can regulate "misleading" ads; obviously, ads for illegal goods and activities are also unprotected.

There's a hot area of free speech law right now in the extent to which the government can also compel certain kinds of commercial speech, the classic example is warning labels on cigarette packages. 

#### Expressive conduct: protected, but more weakly than normal

The classic example and leading on case of expressive conduct is burning a draft card to protest the Vietnam war.  U.S. v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968).  It's speech, because it was meant to express something, but it's also conduct, it actually destroyed a government form and (arguably) impeded the draft process.

Regulation of such expressive conduct gets intermediate scrutiny, but the same kind of weird intermediate scrutiny as in Ward v. Rock, that is, based on non-speech-suppressive interests and with the confusing language that sounds kind of strict-scrutiny-ish. So in the draft card case, the regulation prohibiting their destruction was constitutional because the government actually used draft cards for, you know, administering the draft. So defendant could be punished for burning it, not in order to punish the protest, but in order to prevent people from screwing up the draft bureaucracy by torching its paperwork.

#### False speech: still protected, but it's a confusing category.

Go back to tort law, and consider defamation and fraud. 

Typically, tort laws regulating false speech are ok, however, there are special rules for defamation, privacy torts, etc. on behalf of public figures. Short version is that the public figure plaintiff has to prove "actual malice," which is a really stupidly named doctrine, because it has nothing whatsoever to do with malice. Rather, what it means is that public figure plaintiff has to prove that defendant either knew it was false or acted with reckless disregard of truth or falsity. 

This is a doctrine that started with public officials, the idea being that we should be more protective of speech directed against officials, because, you know, democracy, and because defamation lawsuits are one nasty traditional way that some governments engage in political censorship---the government of Singapore is particularly notorious for this, for example, and generally the British tradition is pretty bad here. Not great for democracy: imagine if Barack Obama could have sued Donald Trump for saying he wasn't really born in the U.S.! (Maybe a bad example...) But over time it got expanded to generally people who thrust themselves in the public eye, so it's now Barack Obama and Taylor Swift.

Other kinds of false speech are a little confusing. In U.S. v. Alvarez, Justice Kennedy for a plurality (Kennedy for a plurality! We're doomed.) affirmed a lower court striking down the "stolen valor act," which prohibited falsely claiming military decorations. Kennedy applied the usual strict scrutiny standard for content-based regulations, and claimed that there was no special constitutional rule permitting regulation of false speech. So there you go.

#### Government employee speech: less protected than usual

If it's on the job and within the scope of job duties, there's no First Amendment protection, *at all* for government employee speech. It's basically government speech then, and the government is entitled to control its own speech. 

Even off the job, the Court applies a balancing test, employee's interest in free speech vs. government's interest in not having the job functions undermined. And this is kind of obvious, right? The President can obviously fire the Secretary of State for secretly writing nazi propaganda or something, because, goodbye credibility of the administration. 

Major cases: Pickering v. Bd. of Educ, 391 U.S. 563 (1967), Garcetti v. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006).

#### The speech of lawyers (you and me!): less protected than usual

Truthful advertisements can't be prohibited, despite the many many attempts of bar associations to do so; the ordinary commercial speech rules apply. This has been a big controversy, for a long time the bar regulated lawyer advertising a lot. 

Speech about pending cases can be regulated if it poses a substantial risk of prejudice, and we can understand this as an ordinary application of the standard doctrine (there's probably a compelling interest in running a fair justice system). One big question is to what extent lawyers can be punished for saying really nasty things about judges, which bar associations often try to do.

#### "Core political speech": extra-protected?  Maybe? Sorta?

You'll often hear talk about "core political speech." The idea there is that the First Amendment, if it means anything, means "protect free debate in democracy," so the courts should be extra-vigilant against restrictions of political speech. That being said, it's not clear that this is a real doctrinal category: political speech gets strict scrutiny for content-based regulations just like everything else does. It's not like there's a kind of extra-super-mondo-mega-strict scrutiny for the political stuff. 

#### Political Campaign Expenditures: Protected. 

The Supreme Court, in a line of cases beginning with *Buckley v. Valeo*, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), has held that campaign expenditures are protected speech.  

The key thing to know about this line of cases is that preventing corruption is a compelling government interest, so Congress can impose campaign finance regulations that are narrowly tailored to prevent corruption. However, corruption is understood only to mean actual bribe-taking. (Particularly, scholars like Zephyr Teachout have argued that corruption should take a broader meaning, like corrupting the electoral process by making it a game for the rich, but the Supreme Court has rejected this idea.)

Note the historical context of this case: Nixon was elected president in 1972. Spiro Agnew, his VP, resigned in 1973 under a cloud of bribery allegations (which turned out to be true) based in his prior disservice as Maryland governor. Nixon, of course, resigned in 1974 because of Watergate. So this was a time when corruption was on everyone's minds, we'd just had the biggest gang of criminals in American history in the Oval Office.

- Making the political process fairer for under-resourced candidates is *not* a compelling interest. So while Congress might be able to do some things (like offer public funding for elections) to level the playing field a bit, they can't engage in (subject-matter-based, I guess) restrictions on speech to do it. 

- Ensuring equal influence for voters of different wealth levels is also not a compelling interest. The Court in *Buckley* essentially just equates this to an interest in censoring the rich, so it maybe isn't even legitimate.

- Reducing the cost of campaigns is also not a compelling interest.

So why is money speech?  Well, here's what the Court said in Buckley: 

> We cannot share the view that the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations are comparable to the restrictions on conduct upheld in O'Brien. The expenditure of money simply cannot be equated with such conduct as destruction of a draft card. Some forms of communication made possible by the giving and spending of money involve speech alone, some involve conduct primarily, and some involve a combination of the two. Yet this Court has never suggested that the dependence of a communication on the expenditure of money operates itself to introduce a nonspeech element or to reduce the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment. For example, in Cox v. Louisiana,, the Court contrasted picketing and parading with a newspaper comment and a telegram by a citizen to a public official. The parading and picketing activities were said to constitute conduct "intertwined with expression and association," whereas the newspaper comment and the telegram were described as a "pure form of expression" involving "free speech alone" rather than "expression mixed with particular conduct." Even if the categorization of the expenditure of money as conduct were accepted, the limitations challenged here would not meet the O'Brien test because the governmental interests advanced in support of the Act involve "suppressing communication." The interests served by the Act include restricting the voices of people and interest groups who have money to spend and reducing the overall scope of federal election campaigns. Although the Act does not focus on the ideas expressed by persons or groups subject to its regulations, it is aimed in part at equalizing the relative ability of all voters to affect electoral outcomes by placing a ceiling on expenditures for political expression by citizens and groups. Unlike O'Brien, where the Selective Service System's administrative interest in the preservation of draft cards was wholly unrelated to their use as a means of communication, it is beyond dispute that the interest in regulating the alleged "conduct" of giving or spending money "arises in some measure because the communication allegedly integral to the conduct is itself thought to be harmful." ... the present Act's contribution and expenditure limitations impose direct quantity restrictions on political communication and association by persons, groups, candidates, and political parties in addition to any reasonable time, place, and manner regulations otherwise imposed.

> A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper, and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech.

In Buckley, the Court upheld some contribution limits, but struck down limits either on independent expenditures (though there are complications about coordinated expenditures, etc.) or on candidate expenditures. The rationale was that independent spending poses less of a risk of corruption than do contributions. The Court also upheld disclosure requirements against a challenge on the basis of *NAACP v. Alabama* associational freedom, but held that they're OK under something like intermediate scrutiny because of interests in deterring corruption, catching violations of contribution limits, and informing voters.  However, the Court notes a possibility that minor parties can come to get exemptions if risk of harassment of members can be proven. (Opening the door to as applied challenges.)

*Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010) made crystal clear that the only compelling interest is preventing quid pro quo corruption (not preferential access etc.). Prohibition on corporate independent spending (from corporate treasury) struck down (no ruling on corporate donations to candidates).

Campaign finance law is super complicated, but here are more concepts that have occasionally come up in the debate

- express advocacy vs issue advocacy: basically, is it ok for independent expenditures, e.g., by nonprofit groups, to explicitly name a candidate?

- PACs/dark money as ways that people can essentially launder finance to get around such laws as are allowd. But talk to an election law person; this stuff gets arcane fast.

in fact there are a huge number of ways to evade contribution limits, and essentially money in politics is unlimited. setting up all kinds of nominally independent organizations, funneling money through party organizations, etc. etc.

*McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission*, 572 U.S. 185 (2014) struck down aggregate contribution limits, i.e., limits on donating total amount to multiple candidates. Didn't strike down individual contribution to candidate limits. So I can contribute up to the individual limit to every candidate in the election if I choose. Why? Again, the idea is about quid pro quo: if you can only donate X to a candidate, the Court thinks it doesn't pose more of a danger of quid pro quo corruption to donate 100X to 100 different candidates.

### Kinds of regulation

On to the "what kind of regulation" question. A few categories here too. 


#### Government speech (and money) 

Typically, the government gets to control its own speech, and can say, e.g., "when you're taking this money, you can't use it to make a case for the opposite of the policy that we're trying to subsidize. (Though there are some limits.) The leading case here is Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), which upheld a restriction on federally funded family planning clinics prohibiting them (basically when they were working on the federal dime) from suggesting that their patients get abortions. 

#### Compelled speech

Compelled speech is fairly straightforward, same strict scrutiny as in the default rule. The classic case is Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1976), which held that the state of New Hampshire can't prosecute Jehovah's Witness for covering up "live free or die" motto on license plate. (The Jehovah's Witnesses are responsible for quite a lot of our First Amendment law, actually. Another huge one is West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, forbidding state from requiring pledge of allegiance in school.)

#### Prior restraints: no, no, no.

A prior restraint is when the government enjoins a particular act of speech before it happens, rather than punishing it after the fact based on general laws. Prior restraint is like a burning oven, just don't touch it. 

There are two classic kinds of prior restraint.  First, a straight-up injunction. This will almost never be granted. (Maybe in cases of dire military necessity, like if the newspaper is about to publish the names of all the CIA agents or something.) 

Second is licensure and permitting regulations, e.g., to hold a public protest on the streets. The basic rule there is that they can be permissible, but only with extremely careful procedural protections, based on objective and definite rules (i.e., like "everyone gets a permit if they apply X days in advance, pay Y fee, and nobody else has already gotten a permit for that date, and hearings have to be held within a week of application," level of rule). The idea is that too much discretion permits content-based regulation to sneak in.


#### Vagueness and Overbreadth

One last important idea: you'll often read First Amendment cases where a law is struck down as "vague" or "overbroad." You need to know what those terms mean and the difference between them (they often appear together but are not the same idea).

A law is vague when it's not clear what speech is permitted. Vague criminal laws are, of course, already prohibited by due process, as you know from crim. But there's extra care in first amendment cases because of a fear that vague laws could create a "chilling effect" on protected speech.

By contrast, a law is "overbroad" if it's constitutional as applied to the actual person standing before the court challenging it, but would be unconstitutional applied to a lot of other people, and it's "substantially overbroad" in that it applies to lots of other constitutionally protected conduct.

To understand it, you first have to understand the difference between facial and as-applied challenges. The standard idea is that a facial challenge to a law says "the law is always unconstitutional, applied to everyone." An as-applied challenge is "the law is unconstitutional as applied to me." The difference between the two is kind of muddled, but the Court has said that facial challenges will rarely be accepted (U.S. v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987)) For present purposes, you can think of most cases as as-applied cases, where the idea is that the law may be unconstitutional on the facts presented, but that it's possible to imagine that the law will be constitutionally applied to different facts.

Overbreadth doctrine, then, is actually best understood as a special First Amendment exception to standing doctrine! Normally, someone who brings an as-applied constitutional challenge to a law has to show that it actually is unconstitutional as applied to his or her situation, but a First Amendment plaintiff can show that even though his or her speech is unprotected, the law prohibits so much protected speech that it should go out anyway. R.A.V v. St. Paul, discussed earlier, could have gone off on an overbreadth challenge; the challengers actually asserted one (the idea being that cross-burning, not protected speech, but the hate speech law covered a whole lot of protected speech), but the Court did them one better and struck the law down under a facial challenge.

Ok, that's a pretty comprehensive overview of First Amendment speech law. There's a lot of it, and there's a good amount of stuff that I've left off, but this hits the basics, enough for you to be able to find your way around the territory, understand what's going on in your bar review course, and so forth. I've included a couple of brief exercises below (2/3 of which are blatantly swiped from real cases), just to stretch your brain, but don't feel obliged to worry about them unless you want. 

\newpage

# Exercise: Volunteer Labor

Finding that many ostensibly public-service-oriented organizations are replacing paid employees with "volunteers" who perform the same function, occasionally for sub-minimum wage stipends, and that such organizations are often fronts for revenue-oriented businesses, Congress passes the "Volunteer Pay Equity Act," which requires that any person who works more than 15 hours per week under the supervision of a single entity, which includes nonprofits, individuals, and unorganized entities with a community of purpose, shall be deemed an employee and must be paid the federal minimum wage.

Immediately after the law's passage, it is challenged by a variety of organizations and entities that rely heavily on volunteer labor, including:

- A presidential campaign committee

- A nonprofit civil rights organization, organized as a non-profit corporation

- An ideologically identified newspaper organized as a for-profit corporation

The plaintiffs claim that, in each case, volunteer labor is essential to their expressive activity, and that, accordingly, the act cannot be constitutionally applied to them.

\newpage

# Exercise: Crypto

Congress finds that strong cryptography raises issues of national security as well as law enforcement, as that cryptography makes it difficult for the government to carry out searches or intelligence investigations. Congress also finds that the United States, because of its strong university system, has an advantage in the production of strong cryptographic algorithms relative to competitor nations.

Accordingly, Congress enacts the Cryptography Assessment Tribunal Statute, which, as the name suggests, establishes a tribunal, within the Department of Defense, to assess the extent to which novel cryptographic algorithms pose a danger to national security or law enforcement, and provides that all persons wishing to distribute or export cryptographic algorithms must apply for a permit to that tribunal before they do so. The statute specifically provides that publication of the details of how to implement any such algorithm in any generally available publication, or on the internet, constitutes distribution, in view of the likelihood that foreign agents or criminals will be able to aquire that algorithm and use it in ways averse to national security or law enforcement. 

Carrie Cryptographer has invented a new cryptographic algorithm, and wishes to publish it in an international journal. She sues seeking a declaratory judgment that CATS is unconstitutional.

- Is the Cryptography Assessment Tribunal Statute constitutional?

- Is there any way that Congress could achieve similar goals in a way that is more likely to be constitutional?

\newpage


# Exercise: Solomon Amendment

A decade ago, before gays and lesbians were fully integrated into the military, the federal government had a policy known as "don't ask, don't tell," on it, gays and lesbians were technically forbidden from military service, but the military was forbidden from asking about sexual orientation, and a gay servicemember who did not disclose his or her sexual orientation would be permitted to remain.

A number of private universities considered this policy to be a violation of their nondiscrimination standards, and accordingly, forbade military recruiters from making use of campus resources. Law schools, in particular, tended to forbid military recruiting by JAG corps.

In response, Congress enacted a law called the "Solomon Amendment," denying federal funding to universities when any part of the university declined to give military recruiters access on the same terms as other employers. A number of law schools filed suit, alleging that the Solomon Amendment violated their First Amendment rights by requiring them to "host or accommodate the military's speech," as well as by participating with speech (eg. recruiting emails) in the recruiting.
