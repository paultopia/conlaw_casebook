# Some Doctrines we Skipped

## Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity

Eleventh Amendment and Sovereign Immunity doctrine are kind of messy. Here's the short version:

The idea of "sovereign immunity" is that a government may not be sued without its consent.

The text of the Eleventh Amendment only strips federal courts of jurisdiction over suits against states by "foreigners" (i.e., suits from citizens of other states, or other countries). As a citizen of Illinois, if I brought suit against Indiana, I wouldn't be entitled to bring it in federal court.^[Some, including on the liberal wing of the current Court, have argued that this merely bars *diversity* jurisdiction, not federal question jurisdiction as well. But the current doctrine, to the extent it's clear, is that the Eleventh Amendment bars both federal question and subject matter jurisdiction. There are also issues about the extent to which the *federal* government has sovereign immunity, but this handout will only discuss the states.]

But the Supreme Court has nonetheless created a much broader sovereign immunity doctrine with no obvious textual foundation.

### How did we get here?

The Eleventh Amendment was originally enacted in response to *Chisholm v. Georgia*, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419 (1793), which allowed a South Carolian to sue Georgia for revolutionary war debts. As Article III of the constitution says that the judicial power extends "to controversies... between a state and citizens of another state," it seemed the original text of the Constitution authorized these suits. Almost instantly (in constitutional time), the Eleventh Amendment was ratified.

Since then, there has been great dispute about the broader implications of the Eleventh Amendment. It has been read as expressing a rule of *sovereign immunity* from suit much broader than its plain terms would otherwise suggest.

According to this theory, the Eleventh Amendment merely captures a preexisting legal principle of sovereign immunity, according to which the Constitution, and in particular Article III, never divested the states of the immunity that they had in the first place.

One way to interpret the Eleventh Amendment on that theory is that *Chisholm* was a mistake, and that all the Eleventh Amendment did was clarify existing law. Like almost any view, this has some support in the writings of the founders; in particular, Hamilton wrote in Federalist 81 a spirited defense of the idea that states remain immune from suit.

It also has a little bit of textual support. The leading words are "The Judicial power of the United States *shall not be construed*" (emphasis mine). The "shall not be construed" language might be read to suggest that the ratifiers were not *changing* existing law, but rather reversing an unfortunate *misconstrual* of existing law---and this is consistent with the idea that the Constitution before the enactment of the Amendment did not strip states of a sovereign immunity that they originally had.

While that kind of theory is highly controversial, it makes the best sense of the Supreme Court cases that have extended sovereign immunity:

- *Hans v. Louisiana*, 134 U.S. 1 (1890), holding that states also have sovereign immunity against suits by their *own* citizens in federal court.

- *Alden v. Maine*, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), holding that states have sovereign immunity in state court too.

### What's The Actual Doctrine?

There's a lot of sovereign immunity doctrine, to which we're not going to devote time in this course. However, for purposes of things like the bar exam, here are some rules:

1. States are immune to suits for damages without their own consent (however, they often do consent, e.g., by statute), by any person, in state or federal court.

2. They're also immune to claims brought in federal administrative agencies.

3. They're also immune to suits in equity (i.e., injunctive relief).

4. Congress cannot (with exceptions relating to Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment) authorize suits against states without their consent.

5. They are *not* immune from suits brought by other states (with the exception for when they're just bringing private claims on behalf of their own citizens) or the federal government.

6. They are also not immune from some kinds of *in rem* suits, which are basically certain kinds of suits involving property, and which include some admiralty and bankruptcy claims.

7. The Eleventh Amendment does not strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear appeals from courts that do have jurisdiction over the original claims (i.e., if a state consents to be sued in state, but not federal court, about some matter, the Supreme Court may hear an appeal).

8. Sovereign immunity does not apply to suits against cities, counties, or other such political subdivisions of a state (except in some circumstances where relief would tap into the state treasury).

### Practical Sovereign Immunity Lawyering

The doctrine of sovereign immunity is not as harsh as it seems for two reasons.

First, as noted above, states often consent to suit (because, democracy). Most states have something like a tort claims act consenting to a broad array of suits, often with procedural requirements like prior notice to the state to give them an opportunity to settle.

Second, and more importantly, the Court has interpreted the doctrine of sovereign immunity in a very formalist sense: only when the state is actually named, or its treasury is directly at risk, does sovereign immunity apply. This means that a plaintiff can often sue a state official for injunctive relief which effectively works against the state.

The key case there is *Ex parte Young*, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which allowed injunctive relief in federal court against state attorney general to prohibit enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional statute. There's some weird theoretical shuck and jive underlying the opinion; I'm happy to talk further about it if you want.

But leaving the theory aside just this once, the practical implications of *Young* are as follows:

1. You can sue a state official for prospective injunctive relief, such as enjoining ongoing policies or practices of the state. These suits are permitted even when complying with the injunction would cost the state money.

2. You cannot sue a state official in their official capacity for damages that will be paid directly by the treasury.^[You also cannot sue for retrospective injunctive relief that requires payment out of the state treasury, e.g., for wrongly denied back payment of welfare benefits. *Edelman v. Jordan*, 415 U.S. 651 (1974).]

3. You *can*, however, sue a state official for damages that they are personally obligated to pay, *even if* the state has agreed to indemnify them.^[However, before doing so, you should make yourself aware of common-law immunities these officials sometimes have, as well as immunities that may be conferred by the statute giving you a cause of action.]

Jargon note: suing a state official for damages that they're personally obliged to pay are called "individual capacity" suits. Suits against a state official for action that they must take on behalf of the state (like for the injunction) are called "official capacity" suits. Item (2) above is equivalent to saying that official capacity suits for damages are not permitted. When we label a suit an "individual capacity" or an "official capacity" suit, we don't refer to the capacity in which the official was *acting*, but the capacity in which the individual was *sued*.^[*Hafer v. Melo*, 502 U.S. 21 (1991)]

### Wrap-up

There are lots of other rules relating to sovereign immunity. I've given you enough to do things like get through the bar exam. But these are actually only **the very basics**. There are lots more rules and exceptions to the above.

If you actually have ambitions to practice in this area, you must spend some focused time learning the rest. There are entire practice manuals devoted to suing the government. There is a [pretty good section of a legal aid practice manual on the subject.](http://www.federalpracticemanual.org/node/47)


## Dormant Commerce Clause

The Supreme Court has concluded that Congress has such a big and overwhelming power over interstate commerce that the states themselves totally lack the power to impede it, even in the absence of federal action.

What does this mean? Well, take an obvious kind of case. Suppose the state of Illinois decides to pass a law requiring its businesses to use raw materials from Illinois if they're the same price or cheaper than out-of-state materials. You have some livestock in Illinois. You better buy Illinois corn, not Iowa corn, if it's available for the same price, or you go straight to the pokey.

By now, you should have a strong intuition that there's gotta be something wrong with that picture. After all, a big part of the point of the commerce clause and of Article I---indeed, a big part of the point of the Constitution in general, as opposed to the Articles of Confederation---was to create a unified national economy. And that obviously wouldn't work if states could start trade wars with one another.

So the Supreme Court has found this broad idea in the sort of whitespace surrounding the Commerce Clause, prohibiting states from taking action to engage in economic protectionism against other states. And the name of the set of doctrines that cover this is the "dormant commerce clause."

(FYI, quick vocabulary note: "protectionism" is a term that means "regulations meant to prefer local commerce over outsiders." The idea of the word is that advocates of protectionism are trying to "protect" their own producers against outside competition.)

### What's the Black-Letter Law?

There's a little uncertainty around the margins of the doctrine, but most people would summarize the rule as:

1. If states discriminate against interstate commerce, the regulation is struck down unless it passes something like strict scrutiny;

2. If states adopt regulations that do not discriminate against interstate commerce but do burden interstate commerce, the regulation is subject to a balancing test that weighs the burden on interstate commerce against the state's interest in regulating.

### What's a discrimination against interstate commerce?

There are basically three kinds of discrimination:

1. Facial discrimination,

2. Discrimination with a protectionist purpose, and

3. Discrimination with a protectionist effect.

The easiest case is where a state flat-out makes a law treating interstate commerce differently. Big example: *Philadelphia v. NJ*, you can't import garbage from out of state. This is called "facial discrimination." The word "facial" here doesn't refer to a beauty product. Rather, it means "on the face of the law," that is, written right into the text. (Just like in Equal Protection.)

For example, here's a facially discriminatory tax: "No grocery stores may sell fruits in Hawaii unless those fruits were grown in Hawaii."

By contrast, here's a tax that is clearly discriminatory, but isn't *facially* discriminatory against interstate commerce: "No grocery stores may sell fruits other than pineapples in Hawaii." That doesn't explicitly, that is, "facially," discriminate against non-Hawaiian produce, but it still discriminates because *who else grows pineapples in the U.S., huh?*

The cases contain reveal a few subtle issues, however. First, it isn't just regulations like "nobody from out of state shall bring their dirty trash in to dump in a landfill in New Jersey" that count. Discriminatory taxes count as well.^[Also, it doesn't just have to be a law, like on the statute books. Discriminatory application of non-discriminatory laws can count too, like if a licensing authority just *by an amazing coincidence* exercises its discretion to grant licenses to in-staters but not out-of-staters.] Subsidies out of general revenue *do not* count, but they cannot be structured as discriminatory tax exemptions or taxes on an industry that are earmarked to be rebates to local producers. For example, Illinois can subsidize corn farmers out of the taxes we all pay, but it can't impose a tax on corn and then give a rebate to the Illinois farmers.

When we get into protectionist purpose and effect, the easiest way to think about it is in terms of two key issues^[Note: this isn't really formal "doctrine," as such, but I do think these are helpful rules of thumb.]:

1. Does the law exclude everyone out of state from its benefits/injure everyone out of state in the industry, or just some people?

2. Does the law have some plausible public purpose other than protectionism?

People sometimes talk about "strict scrutiny" in the dormant commerce clause context, but it's not completely clear that the strict scrutiny you know from the 14th Amendment (etc.) context is *exactly* the same thing that happens with protectionist legislation in dormant commerce clause cases (sometimes the Court talks about "important" interests, for example). It's probably close enough to use as a general working idea of what's going on.

In the dormant commerce clause case, this mostly means that very few cases of actual protectionism will go through. One likely exception would be quarantine laws, like those prior cases discussed in *Philadelphia v. New Jersey*, because of the compelling interest in preventing, e.g., the movement of diseased cattle.

### What's the market participant exception?

Sometimes states act like ordinary economic actors---owning factories, buying and selling products, hiring construction workers, etc. The market participant exception allows states to discriminate in favor of their own residents. If Illinois owns a car repair shop, for example, it can give free oil changes to Illinoisans but not to Wisconsinites It can even refuse to sell oil changes to Wisconsinites altogether.

However, there's a very difficult-to-understand case called *South Central Timber Development v. Wunnicke* that stands for the proposition that the state can't go too far. But the details are messy.

### Tell me more about burdening interstate commerce.

Sometimes a state imposes a regulation that doesn't treat people from in-state and out-of-state differently at all, but that still makes it harder to conduct interstate commerce. One example is *Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines*, where the Court struck down an Illinois law requiring curved mudguards. The issue here wasn't that Illinois trucks tended to have curved mudguards while out-of-state trucks tended to have straight mudguards or anything like that---there was no reason to think the law favored local interests at all. Rather, the problem was that all the other states allowed straight mudguards and one state required them, so any truck passing through Illinois ---wherever it came from --- would have to change its mudguards at the state line.

What happens next is a balancing test. And in balancing tests, courts have a lot of discretion, so there's not a lot that I can say to help you resolve these cases. In Bibb, there was substantial skepticism about the idea that it had any benefit for the state at all (it was alleged to be a safety benefit), and it was massively inconvenient for trucks to carry two sets of mudflaps, so it was struck down.

### Is there anything else I need to know?

Yes, two important things.

1. The dormant commerce clause is the negative space created by Congress's power over interstate commerce, and its role as the regulator of the national economic market. It follows from this, and the Court has consistently held, that Congress has the power to authorize states to violate the dormant commerce clause. For example, Congress could pass a law providing that "states may forbid the importation of milk from out of state," and then states that did so would be safe from dormant commerce clause challenge for doing so.

2. The privileges and immunities clause also forbids some kinds of state economic discrimination (as well as various kinds of non-economic discrimination) against out-of-staters. There's some overlap (some stuff violates both), but there's not complete overlap: some things might violate privileges and immunities but not the dormant commerce clause, or vice versa.

For your extreme convenience, here are some differences between P&I and dormant commerce clause:

- P&I is an independent constitutional prohibition, Congress *does not* have the power to authorize violations of the privileges and immunities clause.

- P&I only applies to "citizens," which, most importantly, does not include corporations.

- P&I doesn't cover all kinds of commerce, although it does cover important individual economic activity like practicing a profession; it also covers the individual "fundamental" rights that you'll learn about in con law II.

- There's no market participant exception to P&I.

- Also, do not confuse the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV with the privileges and immunities clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. They're totally different things (and the latter is almost, though not quite, a dead letter for unfortunate historical reasons).

## Is the Dormant Commerce Clause Textually Justified?

You might rightfully worry about the dormant commerce clause. Did the Supreme Court just make it up? States, after all, have a general police power, and it does not necessarily follow from the mere fact that Congress is allowed to regulate interstate commerce that states are not so allowed---states and Congress might have concurrent authority over lots of things, so long as the Constitution does not divest states of authority over them.

Article I Sec. 10 specifically divests states of certain powers, including to enter into alliances, coin money, start wars, etc., but it does not explicitly divest states of the power to regulate commerce within its borders in ways that discriminate against interstate commerce.^[There's one textual argument that one might make here: Art. I Sec. 10 prohibts states from taxing imports or exports. But that's usually read to only mean taxing *international* imports and exports. *Woodruff v. Parham*, 75 U.S. 123 (1868), though this case contradicts dicta from an earlier Marshall opinion.]

In the early cases, we see some talk about the possibility that the Commerce clause granted an exclusive power in Congress. But it's not obvious why that should be the case, particularly if we think that Congress always has the power to preempt contrary state laws within its domain if it disagrees with a state regulation (we'll discuss preemption next week). After all, the Constitution already prohibited states from doing stuff that the framers thought was *so dangerous* that we couldn't wait for Congressional preemption to put it down (like starting their own wars).

However, there is reason to think that nonetheless the framers meant to forbid it. After all, there's a ton of stuff in the Federalist Papers, especially from Hamilton, about how bad it is if states interfere with interstate commerce.

**Federalist 7** argues it would be really bad if states could have distinct commercial policy---that essentially it would cause civil war.

> The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful source of contention. The States less favorably circumstanced would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local situation, and of sharing in the advantages of their more fortunate neighbors. Each State, or separate confederacy, would pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself. This would occasion distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on the basis of equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since the earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to those causes of discontent than they would naturally have independent of this circumstance.

* * *

> The opportunities which some States would have of rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would be impatiently submitted to by the tributary States. The relative situation of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an example of this kind. New York, from the necessities of revenue, must lay duties on her importations. A great part of these duties must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other States in the capacity of consumers of what we import. New York would neither be willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of the citizens of her neighbors; nor would it be practicable, if there were not this impediment in the way, to distinguish the customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New Jersey long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit? Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so oppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent weight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating pressure of New Jersey on the other? These are questions that temerity alone will answer in the affirmative.

**Federalist 11** argues that part of the point of the Constitution is to promote united commercial markets:

> An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each by an interchange of their respective productions, not only for the supply of reciprocal wants at home, but for exportation to foreign markets. The veins of commerce in every part will be replenished, and will acquire additional motion and vigor from a free circulation of the commodities of every part. Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States. When the staple of one fails from a bad harvest or unproductive crop, it can call to its aid the staple of another. The variety, not less than the value, of products for exportation contributes to the activity of foreign commerce. It can be conducted upon much better terms with a large number of materials of a given value than with a small number of materials of the same value; arising from the competitions of trade and from the fluctations of markets. Particular articles may be in great demand at certain periods, and unsalable at others; but if there be a variety of articles, it can scarcely happen that they should all be at one time in the latter predicament, and on this account the operations of the merchant would be less liable to any considerable obstruction or stagnation. The speculative trader will at once perceive the force of these observations, and will acknowledge that the aggregate balance of the commerce of the United States would bid fair to be much more favorable than that of the thirteen States without union or with partial unions.

In **Federalist 22**, Hamilton claims trade wars have already happened during the Articles of Confederation, and that they've led to political dissension:

> The interfering and unneighborly regulations of some States, contrary to the true spirit of the Union, have, in different instances, given just cause of umbrage and complaint to others, and it is to be feared that examples of this nature, if not restrained by a national control, would be multiplied and extended till they became not less serious sources of animosity and discord than injurious impediments to the intcrcourse between the different parts of the Confederacy. "The commerce of the German empire is in continual trammels from the multiplicity of the duties which the several princes and states exact upon the merchandises passing through their territories, by means of which the fine streams and navigable rivers with which Germany is so happily watered are rendered almost useless." Though the genius of the people of this country might never permit this description to be strictly applicable to us, yet we may reasonably expect, from the gradual conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.

Still, you might fairly say: "Ok, we get it. Trade wars between the states? Really bad. But the framers also gave us a solution to them: Congress may regulate interstate commerce, and in doing so may use its power under the supremacy clause to make laws that preempt any such local regulations. In the absence of Congressional action, by what right do the courts act?"

That would be a fair question, and really, the only answer I can give you is "that's the doctrine we have."

## Preemption

The doctrine of preemption is a product of the Supremacy Clause: if Acts of Congress enacted pursuant to its constitutional authority are the supreme law of the land, then any other law has to give way. The constitutional term of art for "give way" is "preemption."

Here's a basic example. Suppose Congress passes a law saying that all cars have to be painted in neon, glow in the dark, colors so they're easier to see at night. And suppose the state of Illinois has a light pollution law forbidding glow in the dark paint on vehicles operated within the state.^[Let us assume away any dormant commerce clause objections to that law.] You're picking out the paint color for your car. What do you do?

The answer is simple: you follow the federal law and paint your car with the neon glow sparkle bling. Federal and state law conflict, the federal law is within Congress's power^[assume that's true here because blah blah blah channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce, road safety, hand-wave hand-wave] so the federal law preempts the state law.

### Different kinds of preemption.

The Supreme Court has explicitly named three kinds of preemption. Conceptually, there are really four categories, tracking two dimensions of doctrine, but it's only realistically possible to ever see three of them.

The first dimension: is preemption **express or implied?** Sometimes Congress says "state law in this area is preempted." Sometimes, it just writes legislation, and state law stuff that is inconsistent with that stuff gets preempted automatically, without Congress saying so.

The second dimension: does preemption **cover the whole field or just areas of conflict?** Sometimes, Congress keeps states from legislating in an entire area of human activity; sometimes it just keeps states from legislating where there's a direct conflict between state legislation and federal legislation.

Put together, you have four possible categories of preemption: express field preemption, express conflict preemption, implied field preemption, or implied conflict preemption. *However*, the notion of "express conflict preemption" is kind of silly. Why? Because state law is *always* preempted when it directly conflicts with valid federal law. So Congress never says "state legislation to the contrary is preempted." Why would it? It doesn't need to.^[Congress can, if it wants to, say "state legislation to the contrary is *permitted*, like when it establishes its own regulatory structure for some activity but permits states to establish their own alternative regulatory structures if they want, and decrees that the federal regulations will give way if the states do so. Remember New York v. United States, the commandeering case? That was one of the alternatives the Court mentioned as available to Congress.]

Accordingly, when you see references to "express preemption," we're talking about "express field preemption." And when you see references to "conflict preemption" and "field preemption" we're talking about "implied conflict preemption" and "implied field preemption."

Hereafter, I'll use the terms as given in most sources cases. With no further ado, some details:

**Express preemption** is the easy kind: sometimes Congress says "everything states do in this area is preempted."

Here's an example: do you want to know why airlines can lie to you about everything, overbook flights, and mess you around in dozens of different ways and not get sued for it?^[Grouchy airline victim editorial: in any other industry, "overbooking" would be called "fraud." Selling more stuff than you have traditionally is grounds for a prison sentence.] Here's why: in the Airline Deregulation Act, 49 U.S.C. \S 41713 provides, in relevant part:

> a State... may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier that may provide air transportation under this subpart.

However, even express preemption requires statutory interpretation. Taking this example: what is "related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier?" Does it just cover price controls and direct route regulation, or does it place airlines above the (state) law altogether by preempting things like state contract and tort law?

I'm very sad to report that the answer in the case of the Airline Deregulation Act is the latter. In *Northwest v. Ginsberg*, the Supreme Court held that the Airline Deregulation Act doesn't preempt the rules of contract that the parties may bargain into, but it does preempt state law rules that are imposed on all contracts, like the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, and basically all of state consumer protection law.^[Grouchy airline victim editorial: That's right: thanks to Congress, *an airline is not obligated to act in good faith when it makes a contract with you*.] Incidentally, this was a 9-0 opinion. However, not all cases of express preemption are this broad. It all depends on legislative intent.^[This is a good opportunity to think about the policy consequences of preemption. While there's good reason to have a national air travel market regulated by one central authority, it's also hard to deny that it's much easier for the airlines to lobby/corrupt Congress and the FAA than it would be to do the same in all 50 states, and harder for shafted consumers to influence those central agencies than it is to influence state legislators and regulators. In that way, preemption comes with a real democratic cost.]

**Field Preemption** is where Congress impliedly preempts an entire field of regulation. Typically this is by regulating it all itself (or by handing over responsibility for that area to an administrative agency, in which case Congress's preemptive power will pass through to agency rules issued under its authority---about which, see basically all of administrative law). A court will be more likely to find field preemption in a traditional area of federal concern. Again, remember that this is *implied*: if Congress says "we preempt the whole field," then we have a case of express preemption like the Airline Deregulation act.

There's not a whole lot to say about field preemption, except that, like in express preemption, the the court will look at Congress's intent. We say that if Congress intended to "fully occupy the field," then state law is preempted. And this is so *even if the state law is fully consistent with the federal law and the purposes behind it.* That's the difference between field preemption and conflict preemption: with field preemption (and express preemption) the state can't legislate *even if everything the state does is totally compatible with what the feds did*.

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission, 461 U.S. 190 (1983) is a nice illustration of how there can be disagreement about the extent of the field that Congress intended to occupy, even when all agree that there was a field it did so intend to occupy. In that case, the Court held that Congress intended to occupy the field of safety regulations of nuclear plants, but not of economic regulations of the same.^[*See also, Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.*, 464 U.S. 238 (1984), which further held that Congress's occupying the field of safety regulations did not peeempt state tort claims based on nuclear injuries---in particular focusing on the fact that Congress established a program to indemnify some nuclear plant operators against private tort suits---thus, on the Court's argument, evidencing Congress's belief that such suits could still be brought even after its legislation.]

Sometimes the court will also look at things like the extent of the federal interest in the area and the extent to which allowing states to particpate in regulation will undermine the federal scheme. We can think of those either as independent doctrinal ideas or as guidelines that might lead a court to think that Congress intended preemption (that is, as interpretive principles); it doesn't really matter for the ultimate result.^[One good example of these ideas is *Pennsylvania v. Nelson*, 350 U.S. 497 (1956).]

**Conflict Preemption** comes in two flavors (sub-types). The first is what we might call *impossibility preemption*: it's impossible to obey the federal law and the state law. Congress requires trucks to only have curved mudflaps, Illinois requires trucks to only have straight mudflaps. Nobody can obey both laws, so the Supremacy Clause eats the state law.

The second is what we might call *purposes preemption* (sometimes also called "objectives preemption" or "obstruction preemption" or lots of other things): the state law impedes the purposes/objectives of the federal program. An example is in the PG&E case, where the challenger claimed that California's law conflicted with the federal purpose, embodied in Congress's atomic energy legislation, of promoting nuclear power.

The Court disagreed, largely because it had a different view of the federal purposes than the challenger did. It interpreted Congress's having particularly carved out space for states to enact economic regulations as an indication that the Congressional purpose was not to promote nuclear power *no matter what*, but to promote nuclear power compatible with economic viability judgments made by states. California's making an economic viability judgment, therefore, did not conflict with that Congressional objective.

As you should be able to tell by now, all the action here is in...

### Legislative intent and statutory interpretation

**Hypo**: Suppose Congress passes the following law:

> All widgets made in the United States shall be made with no more than .002mm tolerance between the flange and the squirtle.

and the state of Illinois passes the following law:

> All widgets made in Illinois shall be made with no more than .001mm tolerance between the flange and the squirtle.

Is the Illinois law preempted? That depends. Did Congress intend to set a *floor*---that is, the .002mm tolerance is the least demanding standard that's acceptable for widget-makers, but a state can mandate a more demanding standard? Or did Congress intend to set a *ceiling* as well---there's no more demanding requirement allowed? In the latter circumstance, but not in the former, the Iowa law is preempted.

To sort out the answer to that question, we have to delve into legislative intent. Here are some things the Court might consider:

- What kind of judgments did Congress make in enacting the statute (as evidenced, for example, by legislative history, or by other statutory language), or, in the case of a statute where this decision is made by an administrative agency, what kind of judgments did Congress authorize the agency to make? Are those judgments inconsistent with having a higher standard? For example, is there evidence that Congress balanced the safety needs of a more demanding standard against the economic cost?

- Did Congress comprehensively regulate the area in a way that might suggest that it intended for its regulations to be the only ones covering an area? (That is, did it intend to do field preemption?)

- Is the regulation in a traditional area of state concern or an area where federal regulation is traditionally dominant? The court will be more cautious about finding preemption in the former category.^[I like to think of this as being basically for the same reason that we use trade usage and such to interpret contracts---because when people make decisions and utter legally significant words, they do so against a backdrop of prior behavioral and linguistic practice, and if they mean to upset that prior practice, they're likely to recognize the need to do so explicitly. Accordingly, the courts will tend to require Congress to use more explicit words if it preempts state regulation in an area (like education, family law, etc.) traditionally controlled by the states, and will find preemption with a hair trigger in areas like foreign relations that are characterized by pervasive federal authority.]

Statutory interpretation is a subject all on its own, of which we cannot more than touch the surface in this course. It's very much worth your time to take administrative law or some other class that has a heavy focus on statutory interpretation in order to learn it properly.


## Procedural Due Process

In a lot of ways, the last big doctrinal area we're skipping is the most fundamental doctrine in all of American law: procedural due process. (I'm nonetheless skipping it for sake of time and because it is typically covered in administrative law.)

To begin, why do I say that procedural due process is so fundamental? The answer is that it describes the difference between government power under law and government power not under law. Every government in the world that can fairly be said to be ruled under law must have some kind of doctrine that works something like procedural due process.

To see why, let's look at the relevant part of the Fifth Amendment (the Fourteenth is only different in that it refers to states as the deprivers).

> "No person shall be… deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.[]"

This is about as straightforward a legal rule as you can get. You can't be shot, locked up, or have your stuff taken without due process. Of course, there is no such thing as a straightforward legal rule, so there are many questions we might want to ask about this. Consider the following.

- Who is a person?

- Who are the actors whose behavior this clause regulates?

- What counts as a deprivation?

- What counts as life, liberty, or property?

- What constitutes due process of law?

The answers to a number of these questions are pretty straightforward. For the most part, a person is a legal person: corporations yes, cats no. (My cat excepted.) Likewise, it's pretty clear that this stuff just applies to the government: to the feds through the fifth amendment and through the states through the fourteenth, although we might argue whether the passive voice construction should have meant that it applied to the states from the get-go, or even whether it obligates the government to regulate private violence.

But the last three on this list are less than clear. Let's talk about them.

### What interests?

First, what interests are protected? The Constitution says "life, liberty, and property." We kind of know what life and liberty are. But property? We think we know what that means. You took a class in 1L year, you got the notions of real property, and bundles of rights, and chattel---these are the kinds of things that make up property.

But what about stuff that the government has promised to give you in the future? Well, in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), the Court held that this can be a property right too. The idea is that the recipient has a statutory entitlement to the benefits. And there were determinate statutory standards for who was entitled to receive the benefits. So it looks a lot like a property right---a legal rule saying that persons who meet the following conditions X Y and Z are entitled to get A B and C.

>Appellant does not contend that procedural due process is not applicable to the termination of welfare benefits. Such benefits are a matter of statutory entitlement for persons qualified to receive them. Their termination involves state action that adjudicates important rights. The constitutional challenge cannot be answered by an argument that public assistance benefits are "a 'privilege,' and not a 'right.'" Relevant constitutional restraints apply as much to the withdrawal of public assistance benefits as to disqualification for unemployment compensation, or to denial of a tax exemption, or to discharge from public employment.

So let's think about a hypo for this. Suppose we attended a public university (i.e., subject to the 14th Amendment), and at that hypothetical public university, your professor promised you a passing grade in this class, in exchange for your consistent attendance? Do you have property interest in that?

What if the professor writes it in the syllabus? "everyone who shows up to every class will pass?"

What if it's part of official university policy?

What if the professor makes it into a contract? It looks like it's supported by consideration… the professor wants you to show up to class, you want a passing grade…

If not in your grades, what about your status as a student? If the professor accuses you of cheating on an exam, does the university have to give you some kind of process before trying to expel you? Does it depend on the content of a written policy from the university?

Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), gives some insight on these questions. In that case, the Court held that a state university professor could have a property interest in his job, although he didn't have one in that case. And then later, in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the Court found one in the job of a school security guard.

Here's what the court said in Roth:

> To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it. It is a purpose of the ancient institution of property to protect those claims upon which people rely in their daily lives, reliance that must not be arbitrarily undermined. It is a purpose of the constitutional right to a hearing to provide an opportunity for a person to vindicate those claims.

So what do we get out of this? Number one, a property interest is created by some external law, like state law. You have a property interest only if the state says you're entitled to something.

Number two, it has to be important. You don't get due process if your state employer says that you have to take your lunch break at 12:30 instead of noon.

Number three, it kind of has to look like an entitlement, the kind of thing that you can justifiably rely on being provided under the substantive law in question. And you can usually tell that this is the case more or less by the extent to which the law conditions eligibility for the entitlement on specific facts or rules and operates more or less mechanically rather than by some kind of discretionary policy decision.

And this is important: once an interest is created by state law, the procedures provided in state law do not control the process that is due. What controls is the constitution, which judges whether or not the procedures provided for by the state are sufficient.

### Property interests: summarized

1. Created by state law

2. But once found, state law procedures do not control, how much process is due, constitution does. This is important.

3. Must be an important interest.

3. Must be an "entitlement" --- and we look for a justifiable reliance/expectation, and a test for eligibility that relies on specific fact-finding rather than open-ended policy decision.

### How much process is "due?"

There are lots of different kinds of legal process someone could get before the government deprives them of a life, liberty, or property interest. Let's think about some questions:

- Do you get a hearing before or after deprivation? (often the key issue)

- Do you get a lawyer? If so, is that lawyer to be paid for by the government?

- Do you get to call witnesses? If so, do you get compulsory process to get them (i.e., subpoenas)?

- Do you get to seek discovery from the government?

- Do you have a right to confront witnesses against you (like via cross-examination)?

- Do you have a right to a judicial officer who is independent of the agency that's making an adverse decision? Access to a formal court?

- Do you have a right to an appeal?

In the criminal law, we have a full adversary process with extensive procedural protections for the defendant, and it has to happen before the defendant is deprived of liberty for an extended period of time---that's what the speedy trial right does, forbids the government from taking away people's liberty to a large degree before a hearing. Criminal defendants get a privilege against self-incrimination, a government provided lawyer, a right to confrontation, all kinds of things like that.

By contrast, here's all the court said about the process to be provided to the fired government employee before the firing, in Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 US 532 (1985):

> The essential requirements of due process, and all that respondents seek or the Court of Appeals required, are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement. The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government's interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.

However, the court also made clear that the reason so little process was provided pre-termination was because the employee was also provided with a full hearing after the fact, that is, he could get his job restored ex post. This question of pre-termination vs post-termination process is often the key issue in procedural due process cases.

In Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) the Court laid out a three-part balancing test that has been applied ever since. In application, it's honestly pretty ad hoc---it doesn't actually give courts lots of guidance (and as a result, in actual practice, you will have to look for cases similar to yours). But you still have to give lip service to it, and it tracks a kind of intuitive notion of fair process.

The three parts are:

First, **the weight of the private interest at stake**. A person who is deprived of welfare benefits could end up sleeping on the street or struggling to get food---this is a very significant interest, and there probably ought to be more process before the state deprives someone of that property interest. By contrast, we might imagine, say, if the state seizes your luggage at the airport there's a much smaller private interest at stake. So there's much more reason to have pre-termination process in the hearing in the former case than the latter.

Second is **the risk of erroneous deprivation**. This is a factor that makes the most sense when it's judged against the existing process that the state has provided---remember that procedural due process cases come up when someone challenges an existing procedure. And it can be broken down into two sub-factors. There's the reliability of existing procedures---are they fair? Do they do a pretty good job of getting the right answer? And then there's the marginal benefit of additional procedures---is there something that the government could do which would make the process much more reliable or fair?

Third is **the government's interest in avoiding additional process**. Sometimes the government interest will be purely administrative: extra process costs money and creates an administrative burden, the government has a legitimate interest in keeping its budget down and its bureaucracy as un-cumbersome as possible. However, sometimes the government will also have additional interests in avoiding process. If, for example, there's a military or law enforcement emergency, sometimes the government has a reason to act quickly, and the government has a strong interest in avoiding the delay that would be incurred if it had to provide pre-termination process.

### What counts as a deprivation?

Doesn't everything the government does deprive someone of something? After all, when they pass a law that says "no driving over sixty-five," that deprives me of the liberty to go really fast. When they impose income taxes, they deprive all of us of property. When the city demands that homeowners get a permit before building a shed on their land, it arguably deprives homeowners of both liberty and property. Does everyone get a hearing in all of these cases?

Well, one old case suggests maybe yes. In Londoner v. City and County of Denver, 210 U.S. 373 (1908) the Court held that there had to be a hearing before imposing special assessments on landowners to pay for paving the road adjacent to their land.

So how come I don't get a hearing before the IRS makes the university take a third of my salary out of my paycheck every month? The answer to that is the next case after Londoner: Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 239 U.S. 441 (1915). There, the Court distinguished special assessments directed against particular propertyholders from a *general* increase in the property taxes in an area, applicable to all in the city. The idea is that you're not really being deprived of property when there's a change in general law---and the only process you're "due" is the democratic process.

### Procedural Due Process, Equal Protection, Separation of Powers

You might have noticed that in this sense, procedural due process deeply connects both to equal protection and to separation of powers. If the legislature just wishes to raise revenue, it can do so with a general law (i.e., one that doesn't single out particular people, that doesn't give rise to a class-of-one equal protection claim). But if it wishes to smite a particular person, well, it can't: the application of overall policy (i.e., general law) to individuals is a task for the executive and judiciary.

Let me put all of that a little bit differently and longer, just to make sure it's clear. One way to understand what happened in Bi-Metallic is that procedural due process drew the line between the functions of the judiciary and that of the legislature. The legislature makes rules, but doesn't apply then to any person in particular; a person isn't entitled to the procedural protections of judicial process as long as the legislature sticks to that role. The judicial role begins when decisions start getting made that apply to individuals. (How does the executive fit in all this? Well, the executive applies law to individuals, but typically by invoking judicial process. Also, the executive runs the administrative agencies, and, if you take administrative law, you'll learn that the Bi-Metallic case tracks what ad law people know as the distinction between "regulation" and "adjudication.")

Let's think of this a little more carefully, though. Suppose the legislature makes a law "nobody may drive over sixty-five miles per hour." I don't get to show up in court and demand procedural due process to challenge the law's mere existence. Of course, when I get pulled over for speeding, I get to challenge the application of the law to me by the executive (for example, to claim I wasn't speeding, that the police misinterpreted the statute, or to bring some other, substantive, constitutional challenge to the law), but I don't get to claim that the legislature followed improper procedures in regulating me in the first place, because the law was general. If the legislature enacted a law saying "Paul Gowder doesn't get to drive over sixty-five," then I get to challenge that law on procedural due process grounds in addition to all the rest.

In short: the legislative branch makes general law, but does not get to operate on individuals. Legislative acts, properly understood, typically aren't subject to due process challenge. (What does "general law" mean? Well, maybe the Equal Protection Clause can help?) The judiciary and executive apply those laws to individuals, and are subject to procedural constraint before doing so.

You might think this is kind of alarming. The legislature can't take your property individually. But it can enact generally applicable laws that simply strip away property rights from everyone. But isn't that worse? To be sure, the democratic process protects you against such laws, as the Court pointed out in *Bi-Metallic*. But that's cold comfort: if the government just tried to take your property individually, you'd still have the protections of the democratic process, but you'd also get the protections of the courts. So why is the more dangerous power covered by fewer protections?

One answer we might give is that the democratic process is more effective in regulating generally applicable laws. If Congress just passes a law like "the police go beat up Paul Gowder" or "we take Paul Gowder's stuff" (laws which, respectively, also violate the bill of attainder clause and, in the absence of compensation, the takings clause) then my fellow citizens don't have any particular motivation to put a stop to it. But if Congress passes a law "the police beat everyone up" then there's a pretty good chance the voters will have some things to say about it, because it hurts them too. For that reason, many constitutional scholars would say that one key idea is that the Courts give more scrutiny to laws directed at people who can't defend themselves in the political process.

That is the core message of the most famous footnote in all of constitutional law: footnote four in *United States v. Carolene Products*, 304 U.S. 144 (1938). We've already seen this, but I want to make sure you read it again, so:

> There may be narrower scope for operation of the presumption of constitutionality when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution, such as those of the first ten amendments, which are deemed equally specific when held to be embraced within the Fourteenth.

> It is unnecessary to consider now whether legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment than are most other types of legislation. On restrictions upon the right to vote, see [omitted]; on restraints upon the dissemination of information, see [omitted]; on interferences with political organizations, see [omitted]; as to prohibition of peaceable assembly, see [omitted].

> Nor need we enquire whether similar considerations enter into the review of statutes directed at particular religious, [omitted], or national, [omitted], or racial minorities, [omitted]: whether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.

So if judicial scrutiny is directed at protecting the democratic process, then Carolene Products identifies at least two obvious grounds for invoking that scrutiny. First, "legislation which restricts those political processes which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation," like infringements on voting rights and free speech, and second, " prejudice against discrete and insular minorities ... which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities"

But if we interpret procedural due process as essentially the command that the legislature make generally applicable laws, rather than target particular people, then that leads us right into the Equal Protection Clause. One way to think about all of Equal Protection Clause doctrine is that it fills out the idea of general law:the government is required to have particular reasons before it treats people differently.^[For further discussion in a more academic vein, see my article, "Equal Law in an Unequal World," 99 Iowa L. Rev. 1021 (2014), and also pp. 81-86 of *The Rule of Law in the United States: An Unfinished Project of Black Liberation*.] But this one applies not just to the legislature, but to the executive too, forbidding, for example, racial discrimination in policing.

To understand this on a doctrinal level, let's think about two legal routes a plaintiff might use to attack government action that treats her differently.

The procedural due process route allows a plaintiff to say "this government action singled me out, and I'm entitled to procedural protections before that happens." It isn't an attack on the substantive result: the procedural due process claim in Londoner wasn't "the tax assessment they imposed on me was illegal, or was for the wrong amount." Instead, it's "even if the tax assessment ultimately turns out to be legally correct, I'm entitled to a formal process to allow that to be determined."

By contrast, think about *Village of Willowbrook v. Olech*. Recall that this was a challenge to a city requirement that plaintiff grant a 33 foot easement on her property as a condition of getting a connection to the city water supply. The basis of the challenge was that the plaintiff was treated differently: other citizens seeking water connections had only been required to give up 15-foot easements. Hence, the nub of the claim wasn't procedural---Olech wasn't claiming that she had been denied a hearing. Rather, it was substantive: she claimed that the decision was illegal for unjustifiably treating her differently from everyone else.

So one way to think about both procedural due process and equal protection are as alternative ways for plaintiffs to raise the classic kindergarten claim "UNCLE SAM WAS PICKING ON ME!" As the lawyer for plaintiff, you want to bring a procedural process claim when your client has been picked on by **a general law or power that has been applied to her individually without a hearing**. For example, the government threw your client in jail without a hearing, or the legislature passed a bill of attainder against her (quick exercise: go find out what a bill of attainder is if you don't already know).

By contrast, you want to bring an equal protection "class of one" claim when some government agent has applied some kind of general rule or power to your client but you think the rule itself or its application is **substantively unfair**---there is insufficient reason to treat your client one way and to treat everyone else differently. We'll fill out this notion of "insufficient reason" in the coming weeks, that's the core doctrinal question in equal protection law.

In sum, the key doctrinal difference between EPC and PDP is that EPC is about the *substantive fairness of government action* while PDP is about the *fairness of the procedure that is used to determine government action*.


### Addendum: an algorithm for PDP problems

**Step 1: Is plaintiff challenging individualized state action?**

If YES, proceed to step 2.

If NO, stop here, there's no procedural due process claim.

**Step 2: Does plaintiff have a life, liberty, or property interest?**

If YES, proceed to step 3.

If NO, stop here, there's no procedural due process claim.

UNSURE? Here are some rules of thumb:

- Has the state created an entitlement?

- Do people rely on it?

- Is there an important interest at play?

- Is it the sort of issuewhere the government decision could be right or wrong?

**Step 3: Apply *Matthews* balancing**

- How important is the individual interest?

- What's the government interest in avoiding more process?

- Would additional process make the government decision more accurate?
