## The Five Justiciability Doctrines 

1.  Advisory Opinion: the federal courts will not opine on a legal question without there being an actual dispute. Congress or the President can't just call up the Chief Justice and say "we're considering doing X, is it constitutional?"

2.  Standing: when someone files suit, it has to be about an individual injury, and there has to be some relief the courts can give them.

3.  Mootness: if the dispute in a lawsuit goes away before the case is over, the case has to be dismissed.

4.  Ripeness: a lawsuit cannot be brought until the parties' interests are developed enough for the court to be able to access the evidence and give relief. 

5.  Political question: some issues, particularly of Constitutional law, are committed to the complete authority of the other branches of government, and the judicial branch may not rule on them. 

All of those except for the political question doctrine derive from the "cases" and "controversies" requirement of Article 3, which the Court has interpreted to mean that the judicial branch can only hear genuine disputes between two parties with real opposing interests to be resolved by the court. 

In addition to that textual rationale, there are some well-accepted policy reasons for enforcing the justiciability doctrines. First, there's a worry about wasting judicial resources by resolving cases where people don't have a real stake. Second, there's a worry that if the courts handle cases where there aren't litigants with an incentive to develop the facts and law (because they have actual money or other interests on the table, the court could make garbage precedent, based in inadequate facts and legal argument. The adversary system depends on parties with genuine motives to litigate the cases themselves to the fullest. 

## Standing

A person must have standing in order to bring suit in federal court. Standing doctrine is composed of two types of rules.  First, there are *constitutional* rules, derived from Article III's limitation of the federal judicial power to cases and controversies. Congress cannot confer jurisdiction on federal courts to hear cases that violate a constitutional rule. Second, there are *prudential* rules, judge-made standing rules meant to avoid undue litigation, ensure that the parties who bring cases to the courts are in the best position to develop the issues, etc. Congress has the power to legislatively override prudential standing rules.

The constitutional rules for standing are expressed in Lujan in roughly the following formula:

1.  "the plaintiff must have suffered an 'injury in fact'"  That's "an invasion of a legally protected interest," 

2. "there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of... of the defendant" "not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court," and

3.  "it must be likely... that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision," not "speculative."

In addition, the Court makes clear that: 

1.  An injury in fact has to be "concrete," "particularized" ("must affect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way"), and "actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical," and

2.  The plaintiff has the burden to establish standing.

There are roughly three prudential standing rules:

1. The plaintiff's injury must be in the "zone of interest" that the statute or constitutional provision was intended to protect. This mostly comes up in the context of statutory claims, and the basic idea is that if the plaintiff pleads an injury arising out of a violation of a statute, then the injury the plaintiff suffered must be the kind of injury that Congress intended to protect against (for those of you who remember torts, compare it to the test for negligence per se).^[A key case: *Air Courier Conference of America v. American Postal Workers Union*, 498 US 517 (1991) (Postal employee union lacked standing to challenge regulations waiving U.S. Post Office monopoly statute, because the statute was meant to protect the Post Office, not its employees.)]

2. "Generalized grievances" do not suffice.  The key kind of case where this comes up is in taxpayer standing, where someone challenges government expenditure and the injury they claim is that their tax dollars are being spent on some illegal program. With very few exceptions, these claims are rejected.

3. Third-party lawsuits (suits to vindicate the rights of someone else) are disfavored. However, where the third party has his or her own interest at stake too, sometimes they'll be allowed (classic case: *Craig v. Boren*, alcohol seller challenging sexist drinking age, the plaintiff has an economic interest in having the ability to sell to the people who are forbidden from buying).

A big open question is the extent to which Congress may confer "injury" for the purposes of standing on a plaintiff by giving them a cause of action.

Consider the *qui tam* lawsuit. That is where a private plaintiff brings suit against another private party, but on behalf of the government as a whistleblower, typically in order to recover money fradulently taken from the government---and if they win, the plaintiff gets a cut. With qui tam suits, Congress has essentially recruited private plaintiffs as bounty hunters for government fraud. See casebook discussion of *Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States*, in which the Court approved standing in such cases.

A good exercise is to get very clear on how the qui tam is distinguished from *Lujan*.  At the very least, 1, the plaintiff has a concrete financial stake, and 2, there is another party with an individualized injury---the government---who can basically assign the claim to the plaintiff. Assigning claims is a traditional tool with a long common-law history (insurance companies, etc.).

The Supreme Court recently heard, but punted on, a very interesting case from the 9th Circuit on whether violations of an individual statutory right are sufficient injury to confer standing even in the absence of a concrete real-world harm---Spokeo v. Robins. [UPDATE ME, ALSO, OTHER RECENT STANDING CASES?]

## Mootness

Hypo: Chicago enacts an ordinance licensing a 48-hour "suspicion detention" in the city jail: if a police officer thinks you look suspicious, s/he can lock you up for two days to investigate you. Needless to say, this policy is flamingly unconstitutional.

Plaintiff, a victim of a suspicion detention, files suit seeking an injunction against the practice. Before the case can be heard, the 48-hour period expires, and s/he's released from jail. Is the case justiciable?

In that hypo, the defendant city is likely to argue that plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief is *moot*, because there is no longer any relief that the Court can grant. The plaintiff is already out of jail, and while s/he might have a claim for damages, that isn't the lawsuit that's been filed---the lawsuit that's been filed is for an injunction!

The plaintiff is likely to claim that the injury is "capable of repetition, yet evading review." That is, because the harm is so short, it's difficult for a court to review it before it stops, and so there's unlikely to be any way for a court to hear it. The complexities of this argument are beyond the scope of our coverage in this course, but suffice it to say that the defendant city will argue that it is unlikely that *this particular plaintiff* will be subject to the same illegal behavior again.^[See *DeFunis v. Odegaard*, 416 U.S. 312 (1974) (student's race discrimination claim against state law school admissions was moot when he had been admitted pursuant to a temporary injunction that had been stayed and was in final quarter of law school when case was heard in Supreme Court, notwithstanding possibility that similar discrimination may happen to others).] The result of this hypo is fairly debatable.

Mootness is the doctrine we invoke when a plaintiff has standing at the onset of litigation for a particular claim, but, in a sense, "loses" standing midway through because there's no longer any relief for the court to grant. By contrast, a case is threatened on *standing* grounds when there's no standing at the *beginning* of litigation.^[Compare the hypo above with *City of Los Angeles v. Lyons*, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), holding that victim of illegal police chokehold lacked standing to sue for injunctive relief to prevent future chokeholds (although he did have standing to sue for damages). Lyons filed his suit months after he was choked, and, the Court held, there was no reason to think he'd get choked in the future; accordingly, the case wasn't moot, instead, he'd never had standing in the first place. Lyons gets cited quite a lot in standing doctrine, but it's also an incredibly problematic case. There was a massive racial bias issue that the courts did not consider: the LAPD was notorious for using dangerous chokeholds on black men like the plaintiff. As Justice Marshall pointed out in dissent, 16 people had died in the last 8 years following LAPD chokeholds; 12 of them were black men. When then LAPD-chief Daryl Gates was asked about this racial pattern, his response, infamously, was the claim that the "veins or arteries of blacks do not open up as fast as they do in normal people." (As reported by Erwin Chemerinsky in *The Case Against the Supreme Court*.)]

Mootness is usually only a problem for claims for injunctive relief. Obviously, a damages claim cannot be mooted (unless the defendant outright settles the case by paying the claim), because that's purely retrospective relief---there's always something for the court to grant. It is because injunctions are prospective relief that there's the risk that the world might swoop in and grant the relief that plaintiff is asking the court to grant, mooting the case.

One important rule is that *voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct* is not sufficient to moot a case, for obvious reasons---otherwise the defendant might just turn around and do it again when the case is dismissed. However, there are some subtleties here: sometimes we will say a case is moot when the defendant really conclusively ends the conduct, like by repealing a statute alleged to be unconstitutional.

## Ripeness

Ripeness is kind of the opposite of mootness; the claim is not "you used to have a concrete claim, but you don't anymore," but, rather, "you might have a claim in the future, but not yet."

I am of the (controversial) opinion that ripeness in most real cases is just another way of getting at the absence of standing, i.e., the lack of a concrete or (especially) imminent injury.^[For a recent example of a ripeness case, see National Park Hospitality Association v. Department of Interior, 538 U.S. 803 (2003).]

## Political question

In an odd way, the political question doctrine is kind of the opposite of the sorts of ideas that we saw in Marbury v. Madison. Remember that Chief Justice Marshall's whole argument in Marbury was that the other branches had to obey the Constitution, and the Court's job was to say what the Constitution means, full stop. Now we learn that this isn't completely true, that if, for example, the Constitution says that the Senate shall try all impeachments, the Supreme Court has no business saying what "try," as written in the Constitution, means---that's actually the sole determination of the Senate.

Baker v. Carr, has the core test for political questions. The key passage states a test that runs as follows.

An issue is a nonjusticiable political question if the issue is characterized by one of the following:

1. "a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department" 

2. "a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it,"

3. "the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non judicial discretion," 

4. "the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government," 

5. "an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made," or 

6. "the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question."

The these elements of the test have a few broad ideas in common: 

- The separation of powers means the Court can't decide everything---if it's asked to rule on the internal procedures of another branch (like the Senate's procedures for conducting impeachment in Nixon v. U.S.), or something within the unique competence of another branch, it should probably stay out of it. 

- The functions of the judiciary limit them to handling things that actually are subject to legal determination, not things like "what's a Republican form of government?" (Luther v. Borden.)  

- The U.S. government has to be allowed to govern. If the Court got to set aside government decisions on things like questions of war and peace, it would cripple the government altogether. (Can you imagine the courts calling back troops deployed abroad?!)

# Justiciability hypoes

(A)

The War Powers Resolution is an Act of Congress that purports to prohibit the President from having U.S. military forces deployed more than 2 months without Congressional authorization. 

This is an open (and hotly contested) constitutional issue: the President is commander in chief, but Congress has the authority to declare war, so there's an ambiguity as to whether the power to declare war is a constraint on the President's authority to send troops into battle. (Ditto the powers to make rules for the government and regulation of the armed forces and to fund them.) 

So suppose suppose the President ignores the War Powers Resolutions and sends a ton of troops into battle for a long time without authorization, and then someone sues.

1. Who has standing? Does anyone? 

2: Is it a political question? 

(B)

Congress passes a law: "any person offended by unconstitutional government behavior may have a cause of action for $1,000,000 damages for that behavior against the United States." It then passes a second law, "the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court shall include writs of mandamus for undelivered judicial appointments."  A law school professor, offended by Congress's passing the second law, files suit for damages against the United States. Standing?

(C)

A plaintiff in federal prison sues, alleging that the President uses his or her pardon power in a racially discriminatory fashion---freeing a bunch of white people but no black people. Is this a political question?
