# Incorporation and Second Amendment

The basic problem that incorporation solves is really simple: the Bill of Rights only, on its terms, applies to the federal government.  It's full of lines like "Congress shall make no law," rather than "the states shall make no law." 

Accordingly, there's nothing on its face forbidding the states from, e.g., conducting unreasonable searches, levying cruel and unusual punishments, establishing churches, coercing confessions, and so on, and so on. And this makes sense: the Constitution was supposed to be primarily about enumerating and limiting federal power, right? At the time of the framing, the states had their own constitutions, and those were live things---in Virginia, for example, there were real serious debates about religious freedom in the terms of state law and state ideals; these were rights guaranteed in state courts. (At least, that's one conventional story.)

Like so much else in this course, the Reconstruction Amendments changed all that. After they were enacted, the question quickly arose: did the Reconstruction Amendments make the Bill of Rights apply to the states? That's called the "incorporation" question.

## Privileges and Immunities: the Supreme Court's biggest screwup?

If you've paid attention to the text of the constitution, you might immediately have noticed a piece of text that suggests that it does. The second sentence in section 1, the sentence that includes the due process and equal protection clauses, starts with another clause, the privileges and immunities clause. It reads: "No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges of immunities of citizens of the United States[.]"

Now, here's one natural, indeed, I dare say "literate" thing to think. The Bill of Rights. It describes privileged and immunities of citizens of the United States. To be sure, its protections apply to non-citizens as well, but one thing we ought to be able to say about it is that it also describes the things you're entitled to in this country at a minimum as a citizen---free speech, not having soldiers quartered in your homes, etc. I mean, not having troops lying around eating all my food and scaring the cat---'Murica, in a nutshell, right? Indeed, some Supreme Court justices have thought just this. Most notable, of course, is our greatest hard-line textualist justice, Hugo Black. As always, he's the one who actually likes to read the constitution, and he thought the privileges and immunities clause incorporated the Bill of Rights.

Nope. If you've learned nothing else from our fundamental rights material, you doubtless will have learned that when the Supreme Court has a really easy provision, written right into the constitutional text, that seems to authorize it doing something it wants to do anyway, instead it'll reject that approach and find a totally different, much less textually coherent, way to do it.

So in the Slaughterhouse cases, 83 U.S. 36 (1873), the Court held that the privileges and immunities clause didn't incorporate the Bill of Rights. It also stated---in a case about a state's granting monopoly rights to slaughterhouses, for goodness sakes---a really narrow interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments, basically as only to protect former slaves. All the rest of its other holdings (or dicta, or just general interpretations) have been overturned, but the privileges and immunities clause holding hasn't been. With only one exception, the privileges and immunities clause of the 14th amendment has been a dead letter since then. (The exception is an interstate travel question: Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999) struck down a law restricting welfare benefits for new residents on the basis of the privileges and immunities clause. It was a Stevens decision, and we know he wasn't a big fan of, well, doctrine. It hasn't been followed since.)

## Due Process incorporation

So when the Supreme Court turned around at the end of the 19th and beginning of 20th centuries and actually started applying Bill of Rights protections to the states, guess what clause they used. I'll give you a clue: it's the same clause they use every time they want to make up some constitutional law. Yep, you got it. It's the Due Process Clause again!  Because, YOLO. The Bill of Rights isn't part of the privileges and immunities of citizens, but it is, according to the wise heads on the Supreme Court, part of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause! And, as usual, never mind that on its face all that clause guarantees is process; we'll just use it once again as a second-choice textual hook for our constitutional doctrine.

So they started incorporating the Bill of Rights through the Due Process Clause. And then the debates started. 

## Total vs partial incorporation

The key debate was between total incorporationists and partial incorporationists (and a weird little third position, described by Harlan in Griswold, who just wanted to say "liberty guaranteed by the 14th amendment," full stop, and not even talk about the text of the ten, about which the less said the better.) As usual, Justice Black had what I'll just flat-out call the correct position, as well as the sensible and direct one, namely, total incorporation. And as usual, Justice Black lost.

So instead of incorporating the whole thing, the Court incorporated the Bill of Rights in drips and drabs, and still hasn't incorporated it all. In particular, the Court has explicitly held that the civil jury trial right in the 7th amendment hasn't been incorporated, and neither has the grand jury in criminal cases. Those are the most important ones, where the Court explicitly held "no incorporation," but there are also a few provisions where the Court hasn't reached the question, like the 3rd amendment (of course). There's also some uncertainty about the excessive fines clause of the 8th amendment. But the broad idea, which we'll see in detail when we get to our case for this material, is that the Court incorporates the stuff that seems really really important. As I noted earlier, we see language about "fundamental rights" making a confusing appearance here again.

## Second Amendment

So that's what you really need to know about incorporation. And it's also a good route into the Second Amendment question, because the the Second Amendment was only recently incorporated against the states, as you'll see, in 2010. That's the case we're reading on the subject, McDonald. But you need to know a little about the prior history. 

The prior history is essentially one case: District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008). Two years before McDonald, Scalia, writing for the court, declared that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to bear arms, and struck down a D.C. handgun law.^[Note that because it's D.C., that is, a territory under the direct control of the federal government, the Court didn't need to resolve the incorporation issue in order to strike down that municipal regulation.]

At the time, it was very much an open question whether the Second Amendment created an individual right. The text of the amendment is famously ambiguous: "A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." A big question stood in the path of the Court finding an individual right: what's the deal with this "militia" stuff? Does it mean that the right at issue is only for states to have militias? At the time of the revolution, lots of folks believed that the military force should be state militias, not standing federal armies, and one way to read the Second Amendment is that it is just a reservation of rights to the states to do so. But then there's this "the people" language. Does "the people" mean individuals?

So in Heller, Scalia naturally spent many, many pages doing the originalist thing. The key sentence from Heller summarizes this historical review: " In numerous instances, 'bear arms' was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of an organized militia." So the "prefatory" clause, the militia bit, was understood to support, not to undermine, the notion of bearing arms as a military right. In Scalia's words: "the way tyrants had eliminated a militia consisting of all the able-bodied men was not by banning the militia but simply by taking away the people's arms, enabling a select militia or standing army to suppress political opponents. This is what had occurred in England that prompted codification of the right to have arms in the English Bill of Rights."

### Second Amendment after Reconstruction

The other big question about the Second Amendment as an individual right is, even if one disagrees with Scalia, did the Reconstruction Amendments change its meaning? There's some evidence, much of which Scalia cites, that the radical Republicans were particularly concerned with the way that Southern states disarmed freed slaves (for obvious reasons). Here's a representative passage from Scalia in Heller:

> Blacks were routinely disarmed by Southern States after the Civil War. Those who opposed these injustices frequently stated that they infringed blacks' constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Needless to say, the claim was not that blacks were being prohibited from carrying arms in an organized state militia. A Report of the Commission of the Freedmen's Bureau in 1866 stated plainly: "[T]he civil law [of Kentucky] prohibits the colored man from bearing arms.. Their arms are taken from them by the civil authorities... Thus, the right of the people to keep and bear arms as provided in the Constitution is infringed."

So even if you disagree with the claim that the founders originally thought that the Second Amendment was an individual right, you might think that it became an individual right in what we might call the re-founding of the republic after the civil war. Of course, there's plenty of room to disagree; see the dissents in Heller.

### Bear arms for what purpose?

Particularly, there's a further question, aptly raised by Stevens. Suppose the Second Amendment protects a right to individually bear arms, e.g., to potentially form a militia at some point or to resist a tyrannical English king. Does it also protect an individual right to bear arms for revolution, for hunting, for self-defense, or what? 

This is an important question, because lots of gun regulations require things like trigger locks, disassembled storage, and the like, which make it harder, arguably, to use guns for self-defense against some imaginary burglar, but still perfectly possible to take the gun out and use it to participate in the revolution to throw off the stamp act or some bloody colonial nonsense, or to go out hunting deer, or whatever. Likewise, consider regulations of things like concealed carry: probably won't impede hunting, might impede vigilantism or rebellion. 

The Court had to confront those issues in Heller, and struck down a D.C. trigger lock requirement on the grounds that it would make the weapon less useful for self defense. Scalia again: "We must also address the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times. This makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional." So this substantially restricts the scope of regulations that might be permissible, by constitutionalizing a principle of self-defense use.

### Onto McDonald.

Breyer's dissent in Heller focuses on the idea of a "well-regulated" militia. Doesn't that, just textually, imply that there's a substantial scope for, well, regulation? And then he has a lot of talk about the standard to apply to Second Amendment cases, which Scalia basically just dismisses.

That takes us to McDonald. In reading McDonald, I want you to particularly look for the standard by which the court decides incorporation questions, and also for the way the court uses post-framing history, especially around the time of the civil war. I'd also like you to focus on the question of the messy relationship between incorporation and substantive due process, as discussed by Stevens, and his exchange with Scalia's concurrence---and perhaps even think about it in the context of Harlan's opinion in Griswold. This is a case where the concurrences and the multiple dissents really add a bunch of value to thinking about the root-level constitutional issues in play. We get a bunch of really interesting and important theories about the reconstruction amendments flying about in this case, and it needs to be read very carefully.

# Exercise: Many Gun Regulations

Consider the following gun regulations. Which are constitutional? Which aren't? What arguments might we make on either side?

1.  No citizen may possess more than three guns.

2.  No guns may be stored loaded in a home.

3.  No persons with convictions for any violent crime, at any point in the past, may possess a gun. (Assume here that "violent crime" is defined in a sensible way.)

4.  Before any person is permitted to possess a gun, they must pass a state-licensed firearms safety course. (Assume here that availability and standards in such a course are more-or-less reasonable.)

5.  No firearms with a magazine capacity of more than six bullets may be sold or possessed within the state.

6.  Any firearm possessed in the state must have a biometric trigger lock which effectively prevents it being fired by any person other than the purchaser.

7.  No concealed firearms are permitted in the state; all firearms must be worn openly and visible to the public at all times.

8.  There is a "gun violence remediation tax" assessed yearly on all owners of firearms, assessed at 10% of the market value of each weapon owned.

9.  No firearms may be carried within 1000 yards of any school, playground, nursery, daycare, or public park.

10.  When outside the home, all firearms must be carried inside a locked container that takes no less than one minute to open.

11.  No semi-automatic weapons may be sold or possessed within the state. (N.B., gun advocates (a.k.a. "gun nuts") often argue that gun control advocates (a.k.a. "gun grabbers") misunderstand the definition of a semi-automatic weapon; for present purposes, assume that this law means that no gun may be sold unless it mechanically requires some separate chambering action, independent of a trigger pull, between firings.)

12.  No "hollow-point" bullets may be sold or possessed in the state. (N.B., many gun control advocates argue that "hollow-point" bullets are designed to expand and do more damage to flesh on impact)

13.  No person may buy more than fifty rounds of ammunition per month. (Or some higher number... what's a reasonable limit?)

14.  No person may buy ammunition over the internet or mail order; all must be purchased in person.
