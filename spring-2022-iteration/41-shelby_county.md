# Shelby County v. Holder 

570 U.S. 529 (2013)
    

**CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court**

.
      The Voting Rights Act of 1965 employed extraordinary
    measures to address an extraordinary problem. Section 5
    of the Act required States to obtain federal permission
    before enacting any law related to voting—a drastic depar-
    ture from basic principles of federalism. And §4 of the Act
    applied that requirement only to some States—an equally
    dramatic departure from the principle that all States
    enjoy equal sovereignty. This was strong medicine, but
    Congress determined it was needed to address entrenched
    racial discrimination in voting, “an insidious and perva-
    sive evil which had been perpetuated in certain parts of
    our country through unremitting and ingenious defiance
    of the Constitution.” South Carolina v. Katzenbach. As we explained in upholding
    the law, “exceptional conditions can justify legislative
    measures not otherwise appropriate.”  Reflecting the unprecedented nature of these measures, they were scheduled to expire after five years. 
	
Nearly 50 years later, they are still in effect; indeed,
    they have been made more stringent, and are now sched-
    uled to last until 2031. There is no denying, however, that
    the conditions that originally justified these measures no
    longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions. By
    2009, “the racial gap in voter registration and turnout
    [was] lower in the States originally covered by §5 than it
    [was] nationwide.” Since
    that time, Census Bureau data indicate that African-
    American voter turnout has come to exceed white voter
    turnout in five of the six States originally covered by §5,
    with a gap in the sixth State of less than one half of one
    percent. 
	
      At the same time, voting discrimination still exists; no
    one doubts that. The question is whether the Act’s ex-
    traordinary measures, including its disparate treatment of
    the States, continue to satisfy constitutional requirements.
    As we put it a short time ago, “the Act imposes current
    burdens and must be justified by current needs.”
    
       The Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, in the
    wake of the Civil War. It provides that “[t]he right of
    citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or
    abridged by the United States or by any State on account
    of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,” and it
    gives Congress the “power to enforce this article by appro-
    priate legislation.”
       “The first century of congressional enforcement of the
    Amendment, however, can only be regarded as a failure.” In the 1890s, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia
    began to enact literacy tests for voter registration and
    to employ other methods designed to prevent African-
    Americans from voting. Congress passed statutes outlawing some of these practices
    and facilitating litigation against them, but litigation
    remained slow and expensive, and the States came up with
    new ways to discriminate as soon as existing ones were
    struck down. Voter registration of African-Americans
    barely improved. 
	
        Inspired to action by the civil rights movement, Con-
    gress responded in 1965 with the Voting Rights Act.
    Section 2 was enacted to forbid, in all 50 States, any
    “standard, practice, or procedure . . . imposed or applied
    . . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United
    States to vote on account of race or color.”
    The current version forbids any “standard, practice, or
    procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgement of the
    right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account
    of race or color.”  Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide,
    and is not at issue in this case.
	
        Other sections targeted only some parts of the country.
    At the time of the Act’s passage, these “covered” jurisdic-
    tions were those States or political subdivisions that had
    maintained a test or device as a prerequisite to voting as
    of November 1, 1964, and had less than 50 percent voter
    registration or turnout in the 1964 Presidential election. Such tests or devices included literacy
    and knowledge tests, good moral character requirements,
    the need for vouchers from registered voters, and the like. A covered jurisdiction could “bail out” of coverage if it had not used a test or device in the
    preceding five years “for the purpose or with the effect of
    denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or
    color.” In 1965, the covered States
    included Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South
    Carolina, and Virginia. The additional covered subdivi-
    sions included 39 counties in North Carolina and one in
    Arizona.
	
      In those jurisdictions, §4 of the Act banned all such tests
    or devices. Section 5 provided that no
    change in voting procedures could take effect until it was
    approved by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.—
    either the Attorney General or a court of three judges.  A jurisdiction could obtain such “preclearance”
    only by proving that the change had neither “the purpose
    [nor] the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on
    account of race or color.” 
	
      Sections 4 and 5 were intended to be temporary; they
    were set to expire after five years. In South Carolina v.
    Katzenbach, we upheld the 1965 Act against constitutional
    challenge, explaining that it was justified to address “vot-
    ing discrimination where it persists on a pervasive scale.”
	
      In 1970, Congress reauthorized the Act for another five
    years, and extended the coverage formula in §4(b) to juris-
    dictions that had a voting test and less than 50 percent
    voter registration or turnout as of 1968. That swept in
    several counties in California, New Hampshire, and New
    York. Congress also extended the ban in §4(a) on tests and devices nationwide. 
	
      In 1975, Congress reauthorized the Act for seven more
    years, and extended its coverage to jurisdictions that had
    a voting test and less than 50 percent voter registration or turnout as of 1972.  Congress also amend-
    ed the definition of “test or device” to include the practice
    of providing English-only voting materials in places where
    over five percent of voting-age citizens spoke a single
    language other than English. As a
    result of these amendments, the States of Alaska, Arizona,
    and Texas, as well as several counties in California, Flor-
    ida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and South Da-
    kota, became covered jurisdictions. 
    Congress correspondingly amended sections 2 and 5 to
    forbid voting discrimination on the basis of membership in
    a language minority group, in addition to discrimination
    on the basis of race or color.    Finally, Congress made the nationwide ban on tests and
    devices permanent.
	
       In 1982, Congress reauthorized the Act for 25 years, but
    did not alter its coverage formula. Congress did, however, amend
    the bailout provisions, allowing political subdivisions of
    covered jurisdictions to bail out. Among other prerequi-
    sites for bailout, jurisdictions and their subdivisions must
    not have used a forbidden test or device, failed to receive
    preclearance, or lost a §2 suit, in the ten years prior to
    seeking bailout.
	
       We upheld each of these reauthorizations against con-
    stitutional challenge.
	
       In 2006, Congress again reauthorized the Voting Rights
    Act for 25 years, again without change to its coverage
    formula.  Congress also amended §5 to
    prohibit more conduct than before.  Section 5 now forbids voting changes with
    “any discriminatory purpose” as well as voting changes
    that diminish the ability of citizens, on account of race,
    color, or language minority status, “to elect their preferred
    candidates of choice.” 

Shelby County is located in Alabama, a covered jurisdic-
    tion. It has not sought bailout, as the Attorney General
    has recently objected to voting changes proposed from
    within the county.  Instead, in 2010,
    the county sued the Attorney General in Federal District
    Court in Washington, D. C., seeking a declaratory judg-
    ment that sections 4(b) and 5 of the Voting Rights Act are
    facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunc-
    tion against their enforcement. 
	
	
In Northwest Austin [a prior challenge that didn't reach the issues], we stated that “the Act imposes
    current burdens and must be justified by current needs.” And we concluded that “a departure
    from the fundamental principle of equal sovereignty re-
    quires a showing that a statute’s disparate geographic
    coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it
    targets.” These basic principles guide our review of
    the question before us.
	
“ ‘[T]he Framers of the Constitution
    intended the States to keep for themselves, as provided in
    the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections.’ ” Of course, the Federal
    Government retains significant control over federal elec-
    tions. For instance, the Constitution authorizes Congress
    to establish the time and manner for electing Senators and
    Representatives.  But States have
    “broad powers to determine the conditions under which
    the right of suffrage may be exercised.” And “[e]ach
    State has the power to prescribe the qualifications of its
    officers and the manner in which they shall be chosen.” Drawing lines for congressional districts is likewise “primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.” 
	
       Not only do States retain sovereignty under the Consti-
    tution, there is also a “fundamental principle of equal
    sovereignty” among the States.  Over a hundred years ago, this Court explained
    that our Nation “was and is a union of States, equal in
    power, dignity and authority.” Coyle v. Smith (1911). Indeed, “the constitutional equality of the States is essential to the harmonious operation of the
    scheme upon which the Republic was organized.” Coyle concerned the admission of new States, and
    Katzenbach rejected the notion that the principle operated
    as a bar on differential treatment outside that context. At the same time, as we made clear
    in Northwest Austin, the fundamental principle of equal
    sovereignty remains highly pertinent in assessing subse-
    quent disparate treatment of States.
	
       The Voting Rights Act sharply departs from these basic
    principles. It suspends “all changes to state election law—
    however innocuous—until they have been precleared
    by federal authorities in Washington, D. C.”  States must beseech the Federal Government for permis-
    sion to implement laws that they would otherwise have
    the right to enact and execute on their own, subject of
    course to any injunction in a §2 action. The Attorney
    General has 60 days to object to a preclearance request,
    longer if he requests more information.  If a State seeks preclearance from a three-
    judge court, the process can take years.

And despite the tradition of equal sovereignty, the Act
    applies to only nine States (and several additional coun-
    ties). While one State waits months or years and expends
    funds to implement a validly enacted law, its neighbor
    can typically put the same law into effect immediately,
    through the normal legislative process. Even if a noncov-
    ered jurisdiction is sued, there are important differences
    between those proceedings and preclearance proceedings;
    the preclearance proceeding “not only switches the burden
    of proof to the supplicant jurisdiction, but also applies
    substantive standards quite different from those govern-
    ing the rest of the nation.” 

All this explains why, when we first upheld the Act in
    1966, we described it as “stringent” and “potent.”  We recognized that it
    “may have been an uncommon exercise of congressional
    power,” but concluded that “legislative measures not otherwise appropriate” could be justified by “exceptional conditions.”  We have since noted that the Act
    “authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state
    and local policymaking,” and
    represents an “extraordinary departure from the tradi-
    tional course of relations between the States and the
    Federal Government,”  As we reiterated in
    Northwest Austin, the Act constitutes “extraordinary
    legislation otherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.”

In 1966, we found these departures from the basic fea-
    tures of our system of government justified. The “blight of
    racial discrimination in voting” had “infected the electoral
    process in parts of our country for nearly a century.” Several States had enacted
    a variety of requirements and tests “specifically designed
    to prevent” African-Americans from voting.  Case-by-case litigation had proved inadequate to prevent
    such racial discrimination in voting, in part because
    States “merely switched to discriminatory devices not
    covered by the federal decrees,” “enacted difficult new
    tests,” or simply “defied and evaded court orders.”  Shortly before enactment of the Voting Rights Act,
    only 19.4 percent of African-Americans of voting age were
    registered to vote in Alabama, only 31.8 percent in Louisi-
    ana, and only 6.4 percent in Mississippi. Those figures were roughly 50 percentage points or more
    below the figures for whites. 
	
In short, we concluded that “[u]nder the compulsion of
    these unique circumstances, Congress responded in a permissibly decisive manner.” We also
    noted then and have emphasized since that this extraordinary legislation was intended to be temporary, set to
    expire after five years. 
	
       At the time, the coverage formula—the means of linking
    the exercise of the unprecedented authority with the
    problem that warranted it—made sense. We found that
    “Congress chose to limit its attention to the geographic
    areas where immediate action seemed necessary.”  The areas where Congress
    found “evidence of actual voting discrimination” shared
    two characteristics: “the use of tests and devices for voter
    registration, and a voting rate in the 1964 presidential
    election at least 12 points below the national average.” We explained that “[t]ests and devices are
    relevant to voting discrimination because of their long
    history as a tool for perpetrating the evil; a low voting rate
    is pertinent for the obvious reason that widespread disenfranchisement must inevitably affect the number of actual
    voters.” We therefore concluded that “the coverage
    formula [was] rational in both practice and theory.” 
    It accurately reflected those jurisdictions uniquely characterized by voting discrimination “on a pervasive scale,”
    linking coverage to the devices used to effectuate discrimination and to the resulting disenfranchisement. The formula ensured that the “stringent remedies
    [were] aimed at areas where voting discrimination ha[d]
    been most flagrant.” 
	
       Nearly 50 years later, things have changed dramati-
    cally. Shelby County contends that the preclearance requirement, even without regard to its disparate coverage,
    is now unconstitutional. Its arguments have a good deal
    of force. In the covered jurisdictions, “[v]oter turnout and registration rates now approach parity. Blatantly discriminatory evasions of federal decrees are rare. And minority
    candidates hold office at unprecedented levels.” The tests and devices that
    blocked access to the ballot have been forbidden nation-
    wide for over 40 years. 
	
       Those conclusions are not ours alone. Congress said the
    same when it reauthorized the Act in 2006, writing that
    “[s]ignificant progress has been made in eliminating first
    generation barriers experienced by minority voters, in-
    cluding increased numbers of registered minority voters,
    minority voter turnout, and minority representation in
    Congress, State legislatures, and local elected offices.” The House Report elaborated that
    “the number of African-Americans who are registered and
    who turn out to cast ballots has increased significantly
    over the last 40 years, particularly since 1982,” and noted
    that “[i]n some circumstances, minorities register to vote
    and cast ballots at levels that surpass those of white vot-
    ers.” That Report also explained that there have been “significant increases
    in the number of African-Americans serving in elected
    offices”; more specifically, there has been approximately
    a 1,000 percent increase since 1965 in the number of
    African-American elected officials in the six States originally covered by the Voting Rights Act. 
	
      There is no doubt that these improvements are in large
    part because of the Voting Rights Act. The Act has proved
    immensely successful at redressing racial discrimination
    and integrating the voting process. During the “Freedom Summer” of 1964, in Philadel-
    phia, Mississippi, three men were murdered while working in the area to register African-American voters.  On
    “Bloody Sunday” in 1965, in Selma, Alabama, police beat and used tear gas against hundreds marching in sup-
    port of African-American enfranchisement.  Today both of
    those towns are governed by African-American mayors.
    Problems remain in these States and others, but there is
    no denying that, due to the Voting Rights Act, our Nation
    has made great strides.
	
       Yet the Act has not eased the restrictions in §5 or nar-
    rowed the scope of the coverage formula in §4(b) along the
    way. Those extraordinary and unprecedented features
    were reauthorized—as if nothing had changed. In fact,
    the Act’s unusual remedies have grown even stronger.

Respondents do not deny that there have been im-
    provements on the ground, but argue that much of this
    can be attributed to the deterrent effect of §5, which dissuades covered jurisdictions from engaging in discrimination that they would resume should §5 be struck down.
    Under this theory, however, §5 would be effectively immune from scrutiny; no matter how “clean” the record
    of covered jurisdictions, the argument could always be
    made that it was deterrence that accounted for the good
    behavior.
	
       The provisions of §5 apply only to those jurisdictions
    singled out by §4. We now consider whether that coverage
    formula is constitutional in light of current conditions.
    
      When upholding the constitutionality of the coverage
    formula in 1966, we concluded that it was “rational in both
    practice and theory.” The formula looked to cause (discriminatory tests) and ef-
    fect (low voter registration and turnout), and tailored the
    remedy (preclearance) to those jurisdictions exhibiting
    both.
	
      By 2009, however, we concluded that the “coverage
    formula raise[d] serious constitutional questions.”  As we explained, a statute’s “current burdens” must be justified by “current
    needs,” and any “disparate geographic coverage” must be
    “sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.” The coverage formula met that test in 1965, but no longer does so.
	
      Coverage today is based on decades-old data and eradi-
    cated practices. The formula captures States by reference
    to literacy tests and low voter registration and turnout in
    the 1960s and early 1970s. But such tests have been
    banned nationwide for over 40 years. And voter registration and turnout
    numbers in the covered States have risen dramatically in
    the years since.Racial
    disparity in those numbers was compelling evidence justi-
    fying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula. There is no
    longer such a disparity.
	
      In 1965, the States could be divided into two groups:
    those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter
    registration and turnout, and those without those charac-
    teristics. Congress based its coverage formula on that
    distinction. Today the Nation is no longer divided along
    those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it
    as if it were.

The Government falls back to the argument that be-
    cause the formula was relevant in 1965, its continued use
    is permissible so long as any discrimination remains in the
    States Congress identified back then—regardless of how
    that discrimination compares to discrimination in States
    unburdened by coverage. This argument does not look to “current political
    conditions,” but instead relies on a comparison between the States in 1965. That
    comparison reflected the different histories of the North
    and South. It was in the South that slavery was upheld by
    law until uprooted by the Civil War, that the reign of Jim
    Crow denied African-Americans the most basic freedoms,
    and that state and local governments worked tirelessly to
    disenfranchise citizens on the basis of race. The Court
    invoked that history—rightly so—in sustaining the dis-
    parate coverage of the Voting Rights Act in 1966. 
	
       But history did not end in 1965. By the time the Act
    was reauthorized in 2006, there had been 40 more years of
    it. In assessing the “current need[ ]” for a preclearance
    system that treats States differently from one another
    today, that history cannot be ignored. During that time,
    largely because of the Voting Rights Act, voting tests were
    abolished, disparities in voter registration and turnout
    due to race were erased, and African-Americans attained
    political office in record numbers. And yet the coverage
    formula that Congress reauthorized in 2006 ignores these
    developments, keeping the focus on decades-old data rel-
    evant to decades-old problems, rather than current data
    reflecting current needs.
	
       The Fifteenth Amendment commands that the right to
    vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or
    color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that
    command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for
    the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future.  To serve that purpose, Congress—if it
    is to divide the States—must identify those jurisdictions to
    be singled out on a basis that makes sense in light of
    current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past. 
	
	
      In defending the coverage formula, the Government, the
    intervenors, and the dissent also rely heavily on data from
    the record that they claim justify disparate coverage.
    Congress compiled thousands of pages of evidence before reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The court below and
    the parties have debated what that record shows—they
    have gone back and forth about whether to compare covered to noncovered jurisdictions as blocks, how to disaggregate the data State by State, how to weigh §2 cases
    as evidence of ongoing discrimination, and whether to
    consider evidence not before Congress, among other issues.  Regardless
    of how to look at the record, however, no one can fairly say
    that it shows anything approaching the “pervasive,” “flagrant,” “widespread,” and “rampant” discrimination that
    faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the
    covered jurisdictions from the rest of the Nation at that
    time. 
	
	But a more fundamental problem remains: Congress did
    not use the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula
    grounded in current conditions. It instead reenacted a
    formula based on 40-year-old facts having no logical relation to the present day. The dissent relies on “second generation barriers,” which are not impediments to the
    casting of ballots, but rather electoral arrangements that
    affect the weight of minority votes. That does not cure the
    problem. Viewing the preclearance requirements as tar-
    geting such efforts simply highlights the irrationality of
    continued reliance on the §4 coverage formula, which is
    based on voting tests and access to the ballot, not vote
    dilution. We cannot pretend that we are reviewing an
    updated statute, or try our hand at updating the statute
    ourselves, based on the new record compiled by Congress.
    Contrary to the dissent’s contention, we are
    not ignoring the record; we are simply recognizing that it
    played no role in shaping the statutory formula before us
    today.
	
       The dissent also turns to the record to argue that, in light of voting discrimination in Shelby County, the county
    cannot complain about the provisions that subject it to
    preclearance. But that is like saying that
    a driver pulled over pursuant to a policy of stopping all
    redheads cannot complain about that policy, if it turns out
    his license has expired. Shelby County’s claim is that the
    coverage formula here is unconstitutional in all its appli-
    cations, because of how it selects the jurisdictions sub-
    jected to preclearance. The county was selected based on
    that formula, and may challenge it in court.
	
       The dissent proceeds from a flawed premise. It quotes
    the famous sentence from McCulloch v. Maryland, “Let
    the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the
    constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which
    are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited,
    but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution,
    are constitutional.” But this case is about a part of the sentence that the dissent
    does not emphasize—the part that asks whether a legisla-
    tive means is “consist[ent] with the letter and spirit of the
    constitution.” 
	
       There is no valid reason to insulate the coverage for-
    mula from review merely because it was previously enacted
    40 years ago. If Congress had started from scratch in
    2006, it plainly could not have enacted the present cover-
    age formula. It would have been irrational for Congress to
    distinguish between States in such a fundamental way
    based on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an
    entirely different story. And it would have been irrational
    to base coverage on the use of voting tests 40 years ago,
    when such tests have been illegal since that time. But
    that is exactly what Congress has done.
    
	
**JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE BREYER, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.**

In the Court’s view, the very success of §5 of the Voting
    Rights Act demands its dormancy. Congress was of
    another mind. Recognizing that large progress has been
    made, Congress determined, based on a voluminous rec­
    ord, that the scourge of discrimination was not yet extir­
    pated. The question this case presents is who decides
    whether, as currently operative, §5 remains justifiable,
    this Court, or a Congress charged with the obligation to
    enforce the post-Civil War Amendments “by appropriate
    legislation.” With overwhelming support in both Houses,
    Congress concluded that, for two prime reasons, §5 should
    continue in force, unabated. First, continuance would
    facilitate completion of the impressive gains thus far
    made; and second, continuance would guard against back­
    sliding. Those assessments were well within Congress’
    province to make and should elicit this Court’s unstinting
    approbation.

“[V]oting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.” Ante, at 2. But the Court today terminates the remedy
    that proved to be best suited to block that discrimination.
    The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) has worked to com­
    bat voting discrimination where other remedies had been
    tried and failed. Particularly effective is the VRA’s re­
    quirement of federal preclearance for all changes to voting
    laws in the regions of the country with the most aggravated
    records of rank discrimination against minority voting
    rights.

A century after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amend­
    ments guaranteed citizens the right to vote free of dis­
    crimination on the basis of race, the “blight of racial
    discrimination in voting” continued to “infec[t] the
    electoral process in parts of our country.” Early attempts to
    cope with this vile infection resembled battling the Hydra.
    Whenever one form of voting discrimination was identified
    and prohibited, others sprang up in its place. This Court
    repeatedly encountered the remarkable “variety and
    persistence” of laws disenfranchising minority citizens. To take just one example, the Court, in 1927, held unconstitutional a Texas law barring black voters
    from participating in primary elections, Nixon v. Herndon; in 1944, the Court struck down a
    “reenacted” and slightly altered version of the same law,
    Smith v. Allwright; and in 1953, the Court once again confronted an attempt by Texas to “cir­
    cumven[t]” the Fifteenth Amendment by adopting yet
    another variant of the all-white primary, Terry v. Adams.
	
       Congress learned from experience that laws targeting
    particular electoral practices or enabling case-by-case
    litigation were inadequate to the task. In the Civil Rights
    Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, Congress authorized and
    then expanded the power of “the Attorney General to seek
    injunctions against public and private interference with
    the right to vote on racial grounds.”But circumstances reduced the ameliorative
    potential of these legislative Acts:
	
> Voting suits are unusually onerous to prepare, sometimes requiring as many as 6,000 man-hours spent combing through registration records in preparation for trial. Litigation has been exceedingly slow, in part because of the ample opportunities for delay afforded voting officials and others involved in the proceed­ings. Even when favorable decisions have finally been obtained, some of the States affected have merely switched to discriminatory devices not covered by the  federal decrees or have enacted difficult new tests designed to prolong the existing disparity between white and Negro registration. Alternatively, certain local officials have defied and evaded court orders or have simply closed their registration offices to freeze the voting rolls.” 

Patently, a new approach was needed.
  
  Answering that need, the Voting Rights Act became one
    of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified
    exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation’s his­
    tory. Requiring federal preclearance of changes in voting
    laws in the covered jurisdictions—those States and locali­
    ties where opposition to the Constitution’s commands were most virulent—the VRA provided a fit solution for minor­
    ity voters as well as for States. 
	
       After a century’s failure to fulfill the promise of the
    Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, passage of the
    VRA finally led to signal improvement on this front.  On that matter of cause and effects there
    can be no genuine doubt.

Although the VRA wrought dramatic changes in the
    realization of minority voting rights, the Act, to date, surely has not eliminated all vestiges of discrimination
    against the exercise of the franchise by minority citizens.
    Jurisdictions covered by the preclearance requirement
    continued to submit, in large numbers, proposed changes
    to voting laws that the Attorney General declined to approve, auguring that barriers to minority voting would
    quickly resurface were the preclearance remedy eliminated.  Congress also found that as “registration and
    voting of minority citizens increas[ed], other measures
    may be resorted to which would dilute increasing minority
    voting strength.” Efforts to reduce the impact of minority votes,
    in contrast to direct attempts to block access to the ballot, are aptly described as “second-generation barriers” to
    minority voting.
	
       Second-generation barriers come in various forms. One
    of the blockages is racial gerrymandering, the redrawing
    of legislative districts in an “effort to segregate the races
    for purposes of voting.”  Another is adoption of
    a system of at-large voting in lieu of district-by-district
    voting in a city with a sizable black minority. By switching to at-large voting, the overall majority could control
    the election of each city council member, effectively eliminating the potency of the minority’s votes.   A similar effect could be achieved if the city engaged
    in discriminatory annexation by incorporating majority­
    white areas into city limits, thereby decreasing the effect of VRA-occasioned increases in black voting. Whatever
    the device employed, this Court has long recognized that
    vote dilution, when adopted with a discriminatory purpose, cuts down the right to vote as certainly as denial of
    access to the ballot. 
	

[discussing reauthoriztion and evidence Congress relied on] After considering the full legislative record, Congress
    made the following findings: The VRA has directly caused
    significant progress in eliminating first-generation barriers to ballot access, leading to a marked increase in minority voter registration and turnout and the number of
    minority elected officials. But despite this progress, “second generation barriers constructed to prevent minority voters from fully participating in the electoral process” continued to exist, as well
    as racially polarized voting in the covered jurisdictions,
    which increased the political vulnerability of racial and
    language minorities in those jurisdictions.  Extensive “[e]vidence of continued discrim­
    ination,” Congress concluded, “clearly show[ed] the con­
    tinued need for Federal oversight” in covered jurisdictions. The overall record demon­
    strated to the federal lawmakers that, “without the con­
    tinuation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 protections,
    racial and language minority citizens will be deprived of
    the opportunity to exercise their right to vote, or will have
    their votes diluted, undermining the significant gains
    made by minorities in the last 40 years.” 
	
	
	It is well established that Congress’ judg­
    ment regarding exercise of its power to enforce the Four­
    teenth and Fifteenth Amendments warrants substantial
    deference. The VRA addresses the combination of race
    discrimination and the right to vote, which is “preserva­
    tive of all rights.” When confronting the most constitutionally invid­
    ious form of discrimination, and the most fundamental
    right in our democratic system, Congress’ power to act is
    at its height.

The basis for this deference is firmly rooted in both
    constitutional text and precedent. The Fifteenth Amend­
    ment, which targets precisely and only racial discrimina­
    tion in voting rights, states that, in this domain, “Congress
    shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate
    legislation.” In choosing this language, the Amendment’s
    framers invoked Chief Justice Marshall’s formulation of
    the scope of Congress’ powers under the Necessary and
    Proper Clause.
	
      It cannot tenably be maintained that the VRA, an Act of
    Congress adopted to shield the right to vote from racial
    discrimination, is inconsistent with the letter or spirit of
    the Fifteenth Amendment, or any provision of the Consti­
    tution read in light of the Civil War Amendments. No­
    where in today’s opinion clear recognition of the transformative effect the Fifteenth
    Amendment aimed to achieve. Notably, “the Founders’
    first successful amendment told Congress that it could
    ‘make no law’ over a certain domain”; in contrast, the Civil
    War Amendments used “language [that] authorized trans­
    formative new federal statutes to uproot all vestiges of
    unfreedom and inequality” and provided “sweeping en­
    forcement powers . . . to enact ‘appropriate’ legislation
    targeting state abuses.” 
	
       The stated purpose of the Civil War Amendments was to
    arm Congress with the power and authority to protect all
    persons within the Nation from violations of their rights
    by the States. In exercising that power, then, Congress
    may use “all means which are appropriate, which are
    plainly adapted” to the constitutional ends declared by
    these Amendments. So when Congress acts to enforce the right to vote free from
    racial discrimination, we ask not whether Congress has
    chosen the means most wise, but whether Congress has
    rationally selected means appropriate to a legitimate end.
    “It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of
    [the need for its chosen remedy]. It is enough that we be
    able to perceive a basis upon which the Congress might
    resolve the conflict as it did.” 
	
	
       Until today, in considering the constitutionality of the
    VRA, the Court has accorded Congress the full measure of
    respect its judgments in this domain should garner. South
    Carolina v. Katzenbach supplies the standard of review: “As against the reserved powers of the States, Congress
    may use any rational means to effectuate the constitutional prohibition of racial discrimination in voting.”  Today’s Court does not
    purport to alter settled precedent establishing that the
    dispositive question is whether Congress has employed
    “rational means.”
	
       For three reasons, legislation reauthorizing an existing
    statute is especially likely to satisfy the minimal require­
    ments of the rational-basis test. First, when reauthorization
    is at issue, Congress has already assembled a legislative
    record justifying the initial legislation. Congress is en­
    titled to consider that preexisting record as well as the
    record before it at the time of the vote on reauthorization.
    This is especially true where, as here, the Court has re­
    peatedly affirmed the statute’s constitutionality and Con­
    gress has adhered to the very model the Court has upheld.
    
    Second, the very fact that reauthorization is necessary
    arises because Congress has built a temporal limitation
    into the Act. It has pledged to review, after a span of
    years (first 15, then 25) and in light of contemporary
    evidence, the continued need for the VRA. 
	
       Third, a reviewing court should expect the record sup­
    porting reauthorization to be less stark than the record
    originally made. Demand for a record of violations equivalent to the one earlier made would expose Congress to a catch-22. If the statute was working, there would be less
    evidence of discrimination, so opponents might argue that
    Congress should not be allowed to renew the statute. In
    contrast, if the statute was not working, there would be
    plenty of evidence of discrimination, but scant reason to
    renew a failed regulatory regime. 
	
      This is not to suggest that congressional power in this
    area is limitless. It is this Court’s responsibility to ensure
    that Congress has used appropriate means. The question
    meet for judicial review is whether the chosen means are
    “adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in
    view.” The Court’s role, then, is not to substitute its judgment for that
    of Congress, but to determine whether the legislative
    record sufficed to show that “Congress could rationally
    have determined that [its chosen] provisions were appro­
    priate methods.” 
	
      In summary, the Constitution vests broad power in
    Congress to protect the right to vote, and in particular to
    combat racial discrimination in voting. This Court has
    repeatedly reaffirmed Congress’ prerogative to use any
    rational means in exercise of its power in this area. And
    both precedent and logic dictate that the rational-means
    test should be easier to satisfy, and the burden on the
    statute’s challenger should be higher, when what is at
    issue is the reauthorization of a remedy that the Court has
    previously affirmed, and that Congress found, from con­
    temporary evidence, to be working to advance the legisla­
    ture’s legitimate objective.
 
 
 The 2006 reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act fully
    satisfies the standard stated in McCulloch: Congress may choose any means “appropriate” and
    “plainly adapted to” a legitimate constitutional end. As we
    shall see, it is implausible to suggest otherwise.i
	
	I begin with the evidence on which Congress based its
    decision to continue the preclearance remedy. The surest
    way to evaluate whether that remedy remains in order is
    to see if preclearance is still effectively preventing discrim­
    inatory changes to voting laws.  On that score, the record before
    Congress was huge. In fact, Congress found there were
    more DOJ objections between 1982 and 2004 (626) than
    there were between 1965 and the 1982 reauthorization
    (490).
	
       All told, between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objections blocked
    over 700 voting changes based on a determination that the
    changes were discriminatory. Congress found that the majority of DOJ objections
    included findings of discriminatory intent, and that the changes blocked by preclearance were
    “calculated decisions to keep minority voters from fully
    participating in the political process.” On top of that, over the same time period the DOJ
    and private plaintiffs succeeded in more than 100 actions
    to enforce the §5 preclearance requirements. 
	
	Set out below are
    characteristic examples of changes blocked in the years
    leading up to the 2006 reauthorization:
    
	In 1995, Mississippi sought to reenact a dual voter
          registration system, “which was initially enacted in
          1892 to disenfranchise Black voters,” and for that
          reason, was struck down by a federal court in 1987.
    
	
	Following the 2000 census, the City of Albany,
          Georgia, proposed a redistricting plan that DOJ
          found to be “designed with the purpose to limit and
          retrogress the increased black voting strength . . .
          in the city as a whole.” 
		  
		  In 2001, the mayor and all-white five-member
            Board of Aldermen of Kilmichael, Mississippi,
            abruptly canceled the town’s election after “an
            unprecedented number” of African-American candidates announced they were running for office.
            DOJ required an election, and the town elected its
            first black mayor and three black aldermen. 
			
			In 2006, this Court found that Texas’ attempt to redraw a congressional district to reduce the strength
            of Latino voters bore “the mark of intentional dis­
            crimination that could give rise to an equal protec­
            tion violation,” and ordered the district redrawn in
            compliance with the VRA.  In response, Texas sought to undermine
            this Court’s order by curtailing early voting in the
            district, but was blocked by an action to enforce the
            §5 preclearance requirement.
			
		In 2003, after African-Americans won a majority of
            the seats on the school board for the first time in
            history, Charleston County, South Carolina, pro­
            posed an at-large voting mechanism for the board.
            The proposal, made without consulting any of the
            African-American members of the school board,
            was found to be an “ ‘exact replica’ ” of an earlier
            voting scheme that, a federal court had determined,
            violated the VRA. 

In 1993, the City of Millen, Georgia, proposed to de­
            lay the election in a majority-black district by two years, leaving that district without representation
              on the city council while the neighboring majority­
              white district would have three representatives. 
              Section 5 Hearing 744. DOJ blocked the proposal.
              The county then sought to move a polling place
              from a predominantly black neighborhood in the
              city to an inaccessible location in a predominantly
              white neighborhood outside city limits. 
			  
	In 2004, Waller County, Texas, threatened to prose­
           cute two black students after they announced their
           intention to run for office. The county then at­
           tempted to reduce the availability of early voting in
           that election at polling places near a historically
           black university. 

In 1990, Dallas County, Alabama, whose county
           seat is the City of Selma, sought to purge its voter
           rolls of many black voters. DOJ rejected the purge
           as discriminatory, noting that it would have disquali­
           fied many citizens from voting “simply because
           they failed to pick up or return a voter update
           form, when there was no valid requirement that
           they do so.” 
		   
These examples, and scores more like them, fill the
    pages of the legislative record. The evidence was indeed
    sufficient to support Congress’ conclusion that “racial
    discrimination in voting in covered jurisdictions [re­
    mained] serious and pervasive.” 

Congress further received evidence indicating that
    formal requests of the kind set out above represented only
    the tip of the iceberg. There was what one commentator
    described as an “avalanche of case studies of voting rights
    violations in the covered jurisdictions,” ranging from
    “outright intimidation and violence against minority
    voters” to “more subtle forms of voting rights depriva­
    tions.” This evidence gave
    Congress ever more reason to conclude that the time had
    not yet come for relaxed vigilance against the scourge of
    race discrimination in voting.
	
       True, conditions in the South have impressively im­
    proved since passage of the Voting Rights Act. Congress
    noted this improvement and found that the VRA was the
    driving force behind it. But Congress also found that voting discrimination had
    evolved into subtler second-generation barriers, and that
    eliminating preclearance would risk loss of the gains that
    had been made.  Concerns of this order, the
    Court previously found, gave Congress adequate cause to
    reauthorize the VRA. 
	
I turn next to the evidence on which Congress based its
    decision to reauthorize the coverage formula in §4(b).
    Because Congress did not alter the coverage formula, the
    same jurisdictions previously subject to preclearance
    continue to be covered by this remedy. The evidence just
    described, of preclearance’s continuing efficacy in blocking
    constitutional violations in the covered jurisdictions, itself
    grounded Congress’ conclusion that the remedy should be
    retained for those jurisdictions.
	
      There is no question, moreover, that the covered juris­
    dictions have a unique history of problems with racial
    discrimination in voting.  Consideration of
    this long history, still in living memory, was altogether
    appropriate. The Court criticizes Congress for failing to
    recognize that “history did not end in 1965.” But the Court ignores that “what’s past is prologue.” And “[t]hose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”  Congress
    was especially mindful of the need to reinforce the gains
    already made and to prevent backsliding. 
	
      Of particular importance, even after 40 years and thou­
    sands of discriminatory changes blocked by preclearance,
    conditions in the covered jurisdictions demonstrated that
    the formula was still justified by “current needs.” 
	
      Congress learned of these conditions through a report,
    known as the Katz study, that looked at §2 suits between
    1982 and 2004.  Because the private right of action authorized by §2 of the VRA applies
    nationwide, a comparison of §2 lawsuits in covered and
    noncovered jurisdictions provides an appropriate yardstick
    for measuring differences between covered and noncovered
    jurisdictions. If differences in the risk of voting discrimination between covered and noncovered jurisdictions had
    disappeared, one would expect that the rate of successful
    §2 lawsuits would be roughly the same in both areas. The
    study’s findings, however, indicated that racial discrimination in voting remains “concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for preclearance.” 
	
      Although covered jurisdictions account for less than 25
    percent of the country’s population, the Katz study revealed that they accounted for 56 percent of successful  §2 litigation since 1982. 
    Controlling for population, there were nearly four times as
    many successful §2 cases in covered jurisdictions as there
    were in noncovered jurisdictions. The Katz study further found that §2 lawsuits are more likely
    to succeed when they are filed in covered jurisdictions
    than in noncovered jurisdictions. From these findings---ignored by the Court---
    Congress reasonably concluded that the coverage formula
    continues to identify the jurisdictions of greatest concern.
	
      The evidence before Congress, furthermore, indicated
    that voting in the covered jurisdictions was more racially
    polarized than elsewhere in the country.  While racially polarized voting alone does not signal a constitutional violation, it is a factor that
    increases the vulnerability of racial minorities to dis­
    criminatory changes in voting law. The reason is twofold.
    First, racial polarization means that racial minorities are
    at risk of being systematically outvoted and having their
    interests underrepresented in legislatures. Second, “when
    political preferences fall along racial lines, the natural
    inclinations of incumbents and ruling parties to entrench
    themselves have predictable racial effects. Under circumstances of severe racial polarization, efforts to gain political advantage translate into race-specific disadvantages.”[citing an academic article]
	
      In other words, a governing political coalition has an
    incentive to prevent changes in the existing balance of
    voting power. When voting is racially polarized, efforts by
    the ruling party to pursue that incentive “will inevitably
    discriminate against a racial group.” Just as build­
    ings in California have a greater need to be earthquake­
    proofed, places where there is greater racial polarization
    in voting have a greater need for prophylactic measures to
    prevent purposeful race discrimination. This point was
    understood by Congress and is well recognized in the
    academic literature.
	
      The case for retaining a coverage formula that met
    needs on the ground was therefore solid. Congress might have been charged with rigidity had it afforded covered
    jurisdictions no way out or ignored jurisdictions that
    needed superintendence. Congress, however, responded to
    this concern. Critical components of the congressional
    design are the statutory provisions allowing jurisdictions
    to “bail out” of preclearance, and for court-ordered “bail
    ins.” The VRA permits a jurisdiction to bail out by showing that it has
    complied with the Act for ten years, and has engaged in
    efforts to eliminate intimidation and harassment of voters. It also
    authorizes a court to subject a noncovered jurisdiction to
    federal preclearance upon finding that violations of the
    Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have occurred

Congress was satisfied that the VRA’s bailout mecha­
    nism provided an effective means of adjusting the VRA’s
    coverage over time. H. R. Rep. No. 109–478, at 25 (the
    success of bailout “illustrates that: (1) covered status is
    neither permanent nor over-broad; and (2) covered status
    has been and continues to be within the control of the
    jurisdiction such that those jurisdictions that have a genu­
    inely clean record and want to terminate coverage have
    the ability to do so”). Nearly 200 jurisdictions have suc­
    cessfully bailed out of the preclearance requirement, and
    DOJ has consented to every bailout application filed by an
    eligible jurisdiction since the current bailout procedure
    became effective in 1984. The bail-in mechanism has also worked. Several jurisdic­
    tions have been subject to federal preclearance by court
    orders, including the States of New Mexico and Arkansas.

This experience exposes the inaccuracy of the Court’s
    portrayal of the Act as static, unchanged since 1965.
    Congress designed the VRA to be a dynamic statute, capa­
    ble of adjusting to changing conditions. True, many covered jurisdictions have not been able to bail out due to
    recent acts of noncompliance with the VRA, but that truth
    reinforces the congressional judgment that these jurisdic­
    tions were rightfully subject to preclearance, and ought to
    remain under that regime.


Congress approached the 2006 reauthorization of the
    VRA with great care and seriousness. The same cannot be
    said of the Court’s opinion today. The Court makes no
    genuine attempt to engage with the massive legislative
    record that Congress assembled. Instead, it relies on
    increases in voter registration and turnout as if that were
    the whole story. Without even
    identifying a standard of review, the Court dismissively
    brushes off arguments based on “data from the record,” and
    declines to enter the “debat[e about] what [the] record
    shows.” One would expect more from an
    opinion striking at the heart of the Nation’s signal piece of
    civil-rights legislation.
	
      I note the most disturbing lapses. First, by what right,
    given its usual restraint, does the Court even address
    Shelby County’s facial challenge to the VRA? Second, the
    Court veers away from controlling precedent regarding the
    “equal sovereignty” doctrine without even acknowledging
    that it is doing so. Third, hardly showing the respect
    ordinarily paid when Congress acts to implement the Civil
    War Amendments, and as just stressed, the Court does not
    even deign to grapple with the legislative record.
	
      Shelby County launched a purely facial challenge to the
    VRA’s 2006 reauthorization. “A facial challenge to a
    legislative Act,” the Court has other times said, “is, of
    course, the most difficult challenge to mount successfully,
    since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.” United States v. Salerno (1987).
	
       “[U]nder our constitutional system[,] courts are not
    roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the
    validity of the Nation’s laws.” Instead, the “judicial Power” is
    limited to deciding particular “Cases” and “Controversies.”
    U. S. Const., Art. III, §2. “Embedded in the traditional
    rules governing constitutional adjudication is the principle
    that a person to whom a statute may constitutionally be
    applied will not be heard to challenge that statute on the
    ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitution­
    ally to others, in other situations not before the Court.” Yet the Court’s opinion in
    this case contains not a word explaining why Congress
    lacks the power to subject to preclearance the particular
    plaintiff that initiated this lawsuit---Shelby County, Ala­
    bama. The reason for the Court’s silence is apparent, for
    as applied to Shelby County, the VRA’s preclearance
    requirement is hardly contestable.
	
       Alabama is home to Selma, site of the “Bloody Sunday”
    beatings of civil-rights demonstrators that served as the
    catalyst for the VRA’s enactment. Following those events,
    Martin Luther King, Jr., led a march from Selma to Mont­
    gomery, Alabama’s capital, where he called for passage of
    the VRA. If the Act passed, he foresaw, progress could be
    made even in Alabama, but there had to be a steadfast
    national commitment to see the task through to comple­
    tion. In King’s words, “the arc of the moral universe is
    long, but it bends toward justice.” 
	
       History has proved King right. Although circumstances
    in Alabama have changed, serious concerns remain.
    Between 1982 and 2005, Alabama had one of the highest
    rates of successful §2 suits, second only to its VRA-covered neighbor Mississippi. In other words, even while subject to the restraining effect of §5, Alabama was found to have
    “deni[ed] or abridge[d]” voting rights “on account of race or
    color” more frequently than nearly all other States in the
    Union. This fact prompted the
    dissenting judge below to concede that “a more narrowly
    tailored coverage formula” capturing Alabama and a
    handful of other jurisdictions with an established track
    record of racial discrimination in voting “might be defensible.” That is an
    understatement. Alabama’s sorry history of §2 violations
    alone provides sufficient justification for Congress’ determination in 2006 that the State should remain subject to §5’s preclearance requirement.^[This lawsuit was filed by Shelby County, a political subdivision of  Alabama, rather than by the State itself. Nevertheless, it is appropri­  ate to judge Shelby County’s constitutional challenge in light of in­  stances of discrimination statewide because Shelby County is subject to  §5’s preclearance requirement by virtue of Alabama’s designation as a  covered jurisdiction under §4(b) of the VRA.  In any event, Shelby County’s recent record of employing an at-large electoral  system tainted by intentional racial discrimination is by itself sufficient  to justify subjecting the county to §5’s preclearance mandate,]
	
[after giving examples of Alabama discrimination] In 1986, a Federal District Judge concluded that the at-large election systems in several Alabama counties violated §2. Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty. Summarizing its findings, the court
    stated that “[f ]rom the late 1800’s through the present,
    [Alabama] has consistently erected barriers to keep black
    persons from full and equal participation in the social,
    economic, and political life of the state.” 
	
      The Dillard litigation ultimately expanded to include
    183 cities, counties, and school boards employing discrim­
    inatory at-large election systems.  One
    of those defendants was Shelby County, which eventually
    signed a consent decree to resolve the claims against it.

Although the Dillard litigation resulted in overhauls of
    numerous electoral systems tainted by racial discrimination, concerns about backsliding persist. In 2008, for
    example, the city of Calera, located in Shelby County,
    requested preclearance of a redistricting plan that “would
    have eliminated the city’s sole majority-black district,
    which had been created pursuant to the consent decree in
    Dillard.”  Although
    DOJ objected to the plan, Calera forged ahead with elections based on the unprecleared voting changes, resulting
    in the defeat of the incumbent African-American councilman who represented the former majority-black district. The city’s defiance required DOJ to bring a §5 enforcement action that ultimately yielded appropriate redress, including restoration of the majority-black district.
	
These recent episodes forcefully demonstrate that §5’s
    preclearance requirement is constitutional as applied to
    Alabama and its political subdivisions. And under our
    case law, that conclusion should suffice to resolve this
    case. See United States v. Raines (1960) (“[I]f the complaint here called for an application of
    the statute clearly constitutional under the Fifteenth
    Amendment, that should have been an end to the question
    of constitutionality.”). See also Nevada Dept. of Human
    Resources v. Hibbs (2003) (SCALIA, J.,
    dissenting) (where, as here, a state or local government
    raises a facial challenge to a federal statute on the ground
    that it exceeds Congress’ enforcement powers under the
    Civil War Amendments, the challenge fails if the opposing
    party is able to show that the statute “could constitution­
    ally be applied to some jurisdictions”).
	
 This Court has consistently rejected constitutional
    challenges to legislation enacted pursuant to Congress’
    enforcement powers under the Civil War Amendments
    upon finding that the legislation was constitutional as
    applied to the particular set of circumstances before the
    Court. [citing further cases] 
	
	[new section on the "equal sovereignty principle]
	
    Today’s unprecedented extension of the equal sover­
    eignty principle outside its proper domain—the admission
    of new States—is capable of much mischief. Federal statutes
    that treat States disparately are hardly novelties. See,
    e.g., 28 U.S.C. §3704 (no State may operate or permit a
    sports-related gambling scheme, unless that State conducted such a scheme “at any time during the period beginning January 1, 1976, and ending August 31, 1990”); 26 U.S.C. §142(l) (EPA required to locate green building
    project in a State meeting specified population criteria) [other examples]. Do such provisions
    remain safe given the Court’s expansion of equal sovereignty’s sway?
	
       Of gravest concern, Congress relied on our pathmarking
    Katzenbach decision in each reauthorization of the VRA.
    It had every reason to believe that the Act’s limited geo­
    graphical scope would weigh in favor of, not against, the
    Act’s constitutionality. See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 626–627 (2000) (confining preclearance
    regime to States with a record of discrimination bolstered
    the VRA’s constitutionality). Congress could hardly have
    foreseen that the VRA’s limited geographic reach would
    render the Act constitutionally suspect. 
	
	
       In the Court’s conception, it appears, defenders of the
    VRA could not prevail upon showing what the record
    overwhelmingly bears out, i.e., that there is a need for
    continuing the preclearance regime in covered States. In
    addition, the defenders would have to disprove the existence of a comparable need elsewhere. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 61–62 (suggesting that proof of egregious episodes of racial
    discrimination in covered jurisdictions would not suffice to
    carry the day for the VRA, unless such episodes are shown
    to be absent elsewhere). I am aware of no precedent for
    imposing such a double burden on defenders of legislation.


Volumes of evidence supported Congress’ de­
    termination that the prospect of retrogression was real.
    Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is
    continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like
    throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you
    are not getting wet.

The sad irony of today’s decision lies in its utter failure
    to grasp why the VRA has proven effective. The Court
    appears to believe that the VRA’s success in eliminating
    the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclear­
    ance is no longer needed.  With
    that belief, and the argument derived from it, history
    repeats itself. The same assumption---that the problem
    could be solved when particular methods of voting discrimination are identified and eliminated---was indulged and
    proved wrong repeatedly prior to the VRA’s enactment.
    Unlike prior statutes, which singled out particular tests or
    devices, the VRA is grounded in Congress’ recognition of
    the “variety and persistence” of measures designed to
    impair minority voting rights. In truth, the evolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation barriers is
    powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as preclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and
    prevent backsliding.
	
       Beyond question, the VRA is no ordinary legislation. It
    is extraordinary because Congress embarked on a mission
    long delayed and of extraordinary importance: to realize
    the purpose and promise of the Fifteenth Amendment.
    For a half century, a concerted effort has been made to
    end racial discrimination in voting. Thanks to the Voting
    Rights Act, progress once the subject of a dream has been
    achieved and continues to be made.
	
       The record supporting the 2006 reauthorization of
    the VRA is also extraordinary. It was described by the
    Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee as “one of
    the most extensive considerations of any piece of legisla­
    tion that the United States Congress has dealt with in the
    27½ years” he had served in the House. After exhaustive evidence-gathering and deliberative
    process, Congress reauthorized the VRA, including the
    coverage provision, with overwhelming bipartisan support.
    It was the judgment of Congress that “40 years has not
    been a sufficient amount of time to eliminate the vestiges
    of discrimination following nearly 100 years of disregard
    for the dictates of the 15th amendment and to ensure that
    the right of all citizens to vote is protected as guaranteed
    by the Constitution.” That determination of the body empowered to enforce the Civil War Amendments “by appropriate legislation” merits this Court’s utmost respect. In my judg­
    ment, the Court errs egregiously by overriding Congress’
    decision.
