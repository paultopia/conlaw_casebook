# U.S. v. Lopez

514 U.S. 549 (1995)

**Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.**


In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress made it a federal offense
"for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the
individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone." The Act neither regulates a
commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be
connected in any way to interstate commerce. We hold that the Act exceeds the
authority of Congress "[t]o regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.

On March 10, 1992, respondent, who was then a 12th-grade student, arrived at
Edison High School in San Antonio, Texas, carrying a concealed .38 caliber
handgun and five bullets. Acting upon an anonymous tip, school authorities
confronted respondent, who admitted that he was carrying the weapon. He was
arrested and charged under Texas law with firearm possession on school
premises. The next day, the
state charges were dismissed after federal agents charged respondent by
complaint with violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. On appeal, respondent challenged his conviction based on his claim that §
922(q) exceeded Congress' power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. 

We start with first principles. The Constitution creates a Federal Government
of enumerated powers. See U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8\. As James Madison wrote,
"[t]he powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government
are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are
numerous and indefinite." The Federalist No. 45. This constitutionally mandated division of authority "was adopted by
the Framers to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties."  "Just as the separation and independence
of the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serves to prevent the
accumulation of excessive power in any one branch, a healthy balance of power
between the States and the Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny
and abuse from either front." 


In United States v. Darby (1941), the Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, stating:

> The power of Congress over interstate commerce is not confined to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.

In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court upheld the application of amendments to the
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 to the production and consumption of
homegrown wheat. The Wickard_Court
explicitly rejected earlier distinctions between direct and indirect effects
on interstate commerce, stating:

> [E]ven if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.' 


Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, and Wickard ushered in an era of Commerce
Clause jurisprudence that greatly expanded the previously defined authority of
Congress under that Clause. In part, this was a recognition of the great
changes that had occurred in the way business was carried on in this country.
Enterprises that had once been local or at most regional in nature had become
national in scope. But the doctrinal change also reflected a view that earlier
Commerce Clause cases artificially had constrained the authority of Congress
to regulate interstate commerce.

But even these modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power
under the Commerce Clause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits.
In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the scope of the interstate
commerce power "must be considered in the light of our dual system of
government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate
commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex
society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national
and what is local and create a completely centralized government." Since that time, the Court has
heeded that warning and undertaken to decide whether a rational basis existed
for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate
commerce. 


Consistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories of
activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.
See, e.g., Southern R. Co. v. United States, (1911) (upholding amendments to Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in intrastate commerce). Finally, Congress'
commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a
substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially
affect interstate commerce. 

Within this final category, admittedly, our case law has not been clear
whether an activity must "affect" or "substantially affect" interstate
commerce in order to be within Congress' power to regulate it under the
Commerce Clause. We conclude, consistent with the
great weight of our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis of
whether the regulated activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce.

We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in the light of this framework,
to enact § 922(q). The first two categories of authority may be quickly
disposed of: § 922(q) is not a regulation of the use of the channels of
interstate commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate
transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce; nor can §
922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress has sought to protect an
instrumentality of interstate commerce or a thing in interstate commerce.
Thus, if § 922(q) is to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a
regulation of an activity that substantially affects interstate commerce.

First, we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts regulating
intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity
substantially affected interstate commerce. Examples include the regulation of
intrastate coal mining; intrastate extortionate credit
transactions, restaurants utilizing substantial interstate
supplies, inns and hotels catering to interstate guests, and production and consumption of home-grown wheat. These examples are by no means exhaustive, but the pattern is clear. Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation
regulating that activity will be sustained.

Even Wickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce
Clause authority over intrastate activity, involved economic activity in a way
that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not. Roscoe Filburn
operated a small farm in Ohio, on which, in the year involved, he raised 23
acres of wheat. It was his practice to sow winter wheat in the fall, and after
harvesting it in July to sell a portion of the crop, to feed part of it to
poultry and livestock on the farm, to use some in making flour for home
consumption, and to keep the remainder for seeding future crops. The Secretary
of Agriculture assessed a penalty against him under the Agricultural
Adjustment Act of 1938 because he harvested about 12 acres more wheat than his
allotment under the Act permitted. The Act was designed to regulate the volume
of wheat moving in interstate and foreign commerce in order to avoid surpluses
and shortages, and concomitant fluctuation in wheat prices, which had
previously obtained. The Court said, in an opinion sustaining the application
of the Act to Filburn's activity:

> "One of the primary purposes of the Act in question was to increase the market price of wheat and to that end to limit the volume thereof that could affect the market. It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume and variability as home-consumed wheat would have a substantial influence on price and market conditions. This may arise because being in marketable condition such wheat overhangs the market and, if induced by rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price increases. But if we assume that it is never marketed, it supplies a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market. Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce." 

Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with
"commerce" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might
define those terms.3 Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger
regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be
undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore,
be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise
out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the
aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.

Second, § 922(q) contains no jurisdictional element which would ensure,
through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affects
interstate commerce. For example, in United States v. Bass (1971) the Court interpreted former 18 U.S.C. § 1202(a), which made it a crime for a felon to "receiv[e], posses[s], or
transpor[t] in commerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm."  The Court interpreted the possession component of §
1202(a) to require an additional nexus to interstate commerce both because the
statute was ambiguous and because "unless Congress conveys its purpose
clearly, it will not be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state
balance."  The Bass Court set aside the
conviction because although the Government had demonstrated that Bass had
possessed a firearm, it had failed "to show the requisite nexus with
interstate commerce." The Court thus
interpreted the statute to reserve the constitutional question whether
Congress could regulate, without more, the "mere possession" of firearms. See also _United States v. Five Gambling Devices 346("The principle is old and deeply imbedded in our
jurisprudence that this Court will construe a statute in a manner that
requires decision of serious constitutional questions only if the statutory
language leaves no reasonable alternative"). Unlike the statute in Bass, §
922(q) has no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a
discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit
connection with or effect on interstate commerce.

Although as part of our independent evaluation of constitutionality under the
Commerce Clause we of course consider legislative findings, and indeed even
congressional committee findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce, the Government concedes that "[n]either the statute nor its
legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the
effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone."  We agree with the Government that Congress normally is
not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an
activity has on interstate commerce. 
But to the extent that congressional findings would enable us to evaluate the
legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affected
interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect was visible to the
naked eye, they are lacking here.


The Government argues that Congress has accumulated institutional expertise
regarding the regulation of firearms through previous enactments.  We agree, however, with the Fifth Circuit
that importation of previous findings to justify § 922(q) is especially
inappropriate here because the "prior federal enactments or Congressional
findings [do not] speak to the subject matter of section 922(q) or its
relationship to interstate commerce. Indeed, section 922(q) plows thoroughly
new ground and represents a sharp break with the long-standing pattern of
federal firearms legislation." 

The Government's essential contention is that we may determine
here that § 922(q) is valid because possession of a firearm in a local school
zone does indeed substantially affect interstate commerce.  The Government argues that possession of a firearm in a school zone
may result in violent crime and that violent crime can be expected to affect
the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of
violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those
costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be
unsafe.  The Government also argues that the presence of guns in schools poses a
substantial threat to the educational process by threatening the learning
environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less
productive citizenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on the
Nation's economic well-being. As a result, the Government argues that Congress
could rationally have concluded that § 922(q) substantially affects interstate
commerce.

We pause to consider the implications of the Government's arguments. The
Government admits, under its "costs of crime" reasoning, that Congress could
regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to
violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.
 Similarly, under the Government's "national
productivity" reasoning, Congress could regulate any activity that it found
was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law
(including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the
theories that the Government presents in support of § 922(q), it is difficult
to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal
law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.
Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard-pressed to
posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to
regulate.

Justice BREYER focuses, for the most part, on the threat that firearm
possession in and near schools poses to the educational process and the
potential economic consequences flowing from that threat. Specifically, the dissent reasons that (1) gun-related violence is a serious
problem; (2) that problem, in turn, has an adverse effect on classroom
learning; and (3) that adverse effect on classroom learning, in turn,
represents a substantial threat to trade and commerce. This
analysis would be equally applicable, if not more so, to subjects such as
family law and direct regulation of education.

For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its Commerce Clause power, regulate
activities that adversely affect the learning environment, then, a fortiori,
it also can regulate the educational process directly. Congress could
determine that a school's curriculum has a "significant" effect on the extent
of classroom learning. As a result, Congress could mandate a federal
curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught
in local schools has a significant "effect on classroom learning," and that, in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

Under the dissent's rationale, Congress could just as easily
look at child rearing as "fall[ing] on the commercial side of the line"
because it provides a "valuable service--namely, to equip [children] with the
skills they need to survive in life and, more specifically, in the workplace." We do not doubt that Congress has authority under the Commerce Clause
to regulate numerous commercial activities that substantially affect
interstate commerce and also affect the educational process. That authority,
though broad, does not include the authority to regulate each and every aspect
of local schools.

The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity
that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of
interstate commerce. Respondent was a local student at a local school; there
is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there
is no requirement that his possession of the firearm have any concrete tie to
interstate commerce.

To uphold the Government's contentions here, we would have to pile inference
upon inference in a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause to a general police power of the sort
retained by the States. Admittedly, some of our prior cases have taken long
steps down that road, giving great deference to congressional action. The broad language in these opinions has suggested the
possibility of additional expansion, but we decline here to proceed any
further. To do so would require us to conclude that the Constitution's
enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not enumerated, and that there never will be a distinction
between what is truly national and what is truly local,  This we are unwilling to do.
