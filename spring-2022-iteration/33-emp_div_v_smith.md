# Employment Division v. Smith

494 U.S. 872 (1990)

**Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.**

This case requires us to decide whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First
Amendment permits the State of Oregon to include religiously inspired peyote
use within the reach of its general criminal prohibition on use of that drug,
and thus permits the State to deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed
from their jobs because of such religiously inspired use.

Oregon law prohibits the knowing or intentional possession of a "controlled substance" unless the substance has been prescribed by a medical practitioner.  Persons who violate this provision by possessing a controlled substance listed on Schedule I are "guilty of a Class B felony." Schedule I contains the drug peyote, a hallucinogen derived from the plant _Lophophora williamsii Lemaire._ 

Respondents Alfred Smith and Galen Black (hereinafter respondents) were fired
from their jobs with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they
ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a ceremony of the Native American
Church, of which both are members. When respondents applied to petitioner
Employment Division (hereinafter petitioner) for unemployment compensation,
they were determined to be ineligible for benefits because they had been
discharged for work-related "misconduct." The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed
that determination, holding that the denial of benefits violated respondents'
free exercise rights under the First Amendment.

Respondents' claim for relief rests on our decisions in Sherbert v. Verner, Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., and Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm'n of Florida, in which we held that a State could not condition
the availability of unemployment insurance on an individual's willingness to
forgo conduct required by his religion. As we observed in Smith I, however,
the conduct at issue in those cases was not prohibited by law. We held that
distinction to be critical, for "if Oregon does prohibit the religious use of
peyote, and if that prohibition is consistent with the Federal Constitution,
there is no federal right to engage in that conduct in Oregon," and "the State
is free to withhold unemployment compensation from respondents for engaging in
work-related misconduct, despite its religious motivation." Now that the Oregon Supreme Court has confirmed that Oregon does prohibit the religious use of peyote, we proceed to consider
whether that prohibition is permissible under the Free Exercise Clause.

The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, which has been made
applicable to the States by incorporation into the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .  The free exercise of religion means, first and
foremost, the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one
desires. Thus, the First Amendment obviously excludes all "governmental
regulation of religious beliefs as such."  The government may not compel affirmation of
religious belief, punish the expression of religious doctrines it believes
to be false, impose special disabilities on the basis of
religious views or religious status, or lend its power to one
or the other side in controversies over religious authority or dogma.

But the "exercise of religion" often involves not only belief and profession
but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts: assembling with
others for a worship service, participating in sacramental use of bread and
wine, proselytizing, abstaining from certain foods or certain modes of
transportation. It would be true, we think (though no case of ours has
involved the point), that a State would be "prohibiting the free exercise [of
religion]" if it sought to ban such acts or abstentions only when they are
engaged in for religious reasons, or only because of the religious belief that
they display. It would doubtless be unconstitutional, for example, to ban the
casting of "statues that are to be used for worship purposes," or to prohibit
bowing down before a golden calf.

Respondents in the present case, however, seek to carry the meaning of
"prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" one large step further. They
contend that their religious motivation for using peyote places them beyond
the reach of a criminal law that is not specifically directed at their
religious practice, and that is concededly constitutional as applied to those
who use the drug for other reasons. They assert, in other words, that
"prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" includes requiring any
individual to observe a generally applicable law that requires (or forbids)
the performance of an act that his religious belief forbids (or requires). As
a textual matter, we do not think the words must be given that meaning. It is
no more necessary to regard the collection of a general tax, for example, as
"prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]" by those citizens who believe
support of organized government to be sinful, than it is to regard the same
tax as "abridging the freedom . . . of the press" of those publishing
companies that must pay the tax as a condition of staying in business. It is a
permissible reading of the text, in the one case as in the other, to say that
if prohibiting the exercise of religion (or burdening the activity of
printing) is not the object of the tax but merely the incidental effect of a
generally applicable and otherwise valid provision, the First Amendment has
not been offended. 

Our decisions reveal that the latter reading is the correct one. We have never
held that an individual's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an
otherwise valid law prohibiting conduct that the State is free to regulate. On
the contrary, the record of more than a century of our free exercise
jurisprudence contradicts that proposition. As described succinctly by Justice
Frankfurter in "Conscientious
scruples have not, in the course of the long struggle for religious
toleration, relieved the individual from obedience to a general law not aimed
at the promotion or restriction of religious beliefs. The mere possession of
religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political
society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political
responsibilities." We first had occasion to assert that
principle in _Reynolds v. United States (1879),
where we rejected the claim that criminal laws against polygamy could not be
constitutionally applied to those whose religion commanded the practice.
"Laws," we said, "are made for the government of actions, and while they
cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinions, they may with
practices. . . . Can a man excuse his practices to the contrary because of his
religious belief? To permit this would be to make the professed doctrines of
religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect to permit
every citizen to become a law unto himself." 

Subsequent decisions have consistently held that the right of free exercise
does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a "valid and
neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or
prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes)." In Prince v. Massachusetts (1944), we held that a mother could be prosecuted under the
child labor laws for using her children to dispense literature in the streets,
her religious motivation notwithstanding. We found no constitutional infirmity
in "excluding [these children] from doing there what no other children may
do." In Braunfeld v. Brown (1961) (plurality opinion), we upheld Sunday-
closing laws against the claim that they burdened the religious practices of
persons whose religions compelled them to refrain from work on other days. In
Gillette v. United States (1971), we sustained the military Selective Service System against the
claim that it violated free exercise by conscripting persons who opposed a
particular war on religious grounds.

Our most recent decision involving a neutral, generally applicable regulatory
law that compelled activity forbidden by an individual's religion was United
States v. Lee. There, an Amish
employer, on behalf of himself and his employees, sought exemption from
collection and payment of Social Security taxes on the ground that the Amish
faith prohibited participation in governmental support programs. We rejected
the claim that an exemption was constitutionally required. There would be no
way, we observed, to distinguish the Amish believer's objection to Social
Security taxes from the religious objections that others might have to the
collection or use of other taxes. "If, for example, a religious adherent
believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal budget can
be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would
have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the
income tax. The tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to
challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that
violates their religious belief." 

The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars
application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated
action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise
Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom
of speech and of the press, see Cantwell v. Connecticut (invalidating a licensing system for religious
and charitable solicitations under which the administrator had discretion to
deny a license to any cause he deemed nonreligious); Murdock v.
Pennsylvania (1943) (invalidating
a flat tax on solicitation as applied to the dissemination of religious
ideas); or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of
Sisters (1925), to direct the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder (invalidating compulsory school-attendance laws as applied to Amish parents who refused on religious grounds to send their children to school).

The present case does not present such a hybrid situation, but a free exercise
claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right.
Respondents urge us to hold, quite simply, that when otherwise prohibitable
conduct is accompanied by religious convictions, not only the convictions but
the conduct itself must be free from governmental regulation. We have never
held that, and decline to do so now. There being no contention that Oregon's
drug law represents an attempt to regulate religious beliefs, the
communication of religious beliefs, or the raising of one's children in those
beliefs, the rule to which we have adhered ever since Reynolds plainly
controls. "Our cases do not at their farthest reach support the proposition
that a stance of conscientious opposition relieves an objector from any
colliding duty fixed by a democratic government." 

Respondents argue that even though exemption from generally applicable
criminal laws need not automatically be extended to religiously motivated
actors, at least the claim for a religious exemption must be evaluated under
the balancing test set forth in Sherbert v. Verner. Under the Sherbert test, governmental actions
that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified by a
compelling governmental interest.  Applying that test we have, on three occasions, invalidated state
unemployment compensation rules that conditioned the availability of benefits
upon an applicant's willingness to work under conditions forbidden by his
religion.  We have never invalidated any governmental
action on the basis of the Sherbert test except the denial of unemployment
compensation. Although we have sometimes purported to apply the Sherbert
test in contexts other than that, we have always found the test satisfied. In recent years we have abstained from applying the Sherbert test
(outside the unemployment compensation field) at all [citing cases]. 

Even if we were inclined to breathe into Sherbert some life beyond the
unemployment compensation field, we would not apply it to require exemptions
from a generally applicable criminal law. The Sherbert test, it must be
recalled, was developed in a context that lent itself to individualized
governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct. As a
plurality of the Court noted in Roy, a distinctive feature of unemployment
compensation programs is that their eligibility criteria invite consideration
of the particular circumstances behind an applicant's unemployment: "The
statutory conditions [in Sherbert and Thomas ] provided that a person was
not eligible for unemployment compensation benefits if, 'without good cause,'
he had quit work or refused available work. The 'good cause' standard created
a mechanism for individualized exemptions." As the
plurality pointed out in Roy, our decisions in the unemployment cases stand
for the proposition that where the State has in place a system of individual
exemptions, it may not refuse to extend that system to cases of "religious
hardship" without compelling reason. 

Whether or not the decisions are that limited, they at least have nothing to
do with an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of
conduct. Although, as noted earlier, we have sometimes used the Sherbert
test to analyze free exercise challenges to such laws, we have never applied
the test to invalidate one. We conclude today that the sounder approach, and
the approach in accord with the vast majority of our precedents, is to hold
the test inapplicable to such challenges. The government's ability to enforce
generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its
ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, "cannot depend on
measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector's
spiritual development." 
To make an individual's obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the
law's coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State's
interest is "compelling"---permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, "to become
a law unto himself"---contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.

The "compelling government interest" requirement seems benign, because it is
familiar from other fields. But using it as the standard that must be met
before the government may accord different treatment on the basis of race, or before the government may regulate the content of
speech, is not remotely comparable
to using it for the purpose asserted here. What it produces in those other
fields--equality of treatment and an unrestricted flow of contending speech--
are constitutional norms; what it would produce here--a private right to
ignore generally applicable laws--is a constitutional anomaly.


Nor is it possible to limit the impact of respondents' proposal by requiring a
"compelling state interest" only when the conduct prohibited is "central" to
the individual's religion.  It is no more appropriate for judges to determine the
"centrality" of religious beliefs before applying a "compelling interest" test
in the free exercise field, than it would be for them to determine the
"importance" of ideas before applying the "compelling interest" test in the
free speech field. What principle of law or logic can be brought to bear to
contradict a believer's assertion that a particular act is "central" to his
personal faith? Judging the centrality of different religious practices is
akin to the unacceptable "business of evaluating the relative merits of
differing religious claims."  As we reaffirmed only last
Term, "[i]t is not within the judicial ken to question the centrality of
particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular
litigants' interpretations of those creeds."  Repeatedly and in many different contexts,
we have warned that courts must not presume to determine the place of a
particular belief in a religion or the plausibility of a religious claim. 

If the "compelling interest" test is to be applied at all, then, it must be
applied across the board, to all actions thought to be religiously commanded.
Moreover, if "compelling interest" really means what it says (and watering it
down here would subvert its rigor in the other fields where it is applied),
many laws will not meet the test. Any society adopting such a system would be
courting anarchy, but that danger increases in direct proportion to the
society's diversity of religious beliefs, and its determination to coerce or
suppress none of them. Precisely because "we are a cosmopolitan nation made up
of people of almost every conceivable religious preference," and precisely because we value
and protect that religious divergence, we cannot afford the luxury of deeming
presumptively invalid, as applied to the religious objector, every
regulation of conduct that does not protect an interest of the highest order.
The rule respondents favor would open the prospect of constitutionally
required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every
conceivable kind ranging from compulsory military service,
to the payment of taxes, to health
and safety regulation such as manslaughter and child neglect laws, compulsory
vaccination laws,^[*Justice Scalia had a crystal ball??? -PG] drug laws, and traffic laws; to social
welfare legislation such as minimum wage laws, child labor laws, animal cruelty laws, environmental protection laws, and laws providing for
equality of opportunity for the races, see, e.g., Bob Jones University v.
United States (1983). The First Amendment's protection of religious liberty does not
require this.

Values that are protected against government interference through enshrinement
in the Bill of Rights are not thereby banished from the political process.
Just as a society that believes in the negative protection accorded to the
press by the First Amendment is likely to enact laws that affirmatively foster
the dissemination of the printed word, so also a society that believes in the
negative protection accorded to religious belief can be expected to be
solicitous of that value in its legislation as well. It is therefore not
surprising that a number of States have made an exception to their drug laws
for sacramental peyote use.  But to say that a nondiscriminatory religious-
practice exemption is permitted, or even that it is desirable, is not to say
that it is constitutionally required, and that the appropriate occasions for
its creation can be discerned by the courts. It may fairly be said that
leaving accommodation to the political process will place at a relative
disadvantage those religious practices that are not widely engaged in; but
that unavoidable consequence of democratic government must be preferred to a
system in which each conscience is a law unto itself or in which judges weigh
the social importance of all laws against the centrality of all religious
beliefs.

**Justice O'CONNOR, with whom Justice BRENNAN, Justice MARSHALL, and Justice BLACKMUN join as to Parts I and II, concurring in the judgment.**

Although I agree with the result the Court reaches in this case, I cannot join
its opinion. In my view, today's holding dramatically departs from well-
settled First Amendment jurisprudence, appears unnecessary to resolve the
question presented, and is incompatible with our Nation's fundamental
commitment to individual religious liberty.

The Court today interprets the Clause to permit the government to
prohibit, without justification, conduct mandated by an individual's religious
beliefs, so long as that prohibition is generally applicable. But a law that prohibits certain conduct---conduct that happens to be an act of worship for someone---manifestly does prohibit that person's free exercise of his religion. A person who is barred from engaging in religiously motivated
conduct is barred from freely exercising his religion. Moreover, that person
is barred from freely exercising his religion regardless of whether the law
prohibits the conduct only when engaged in for religious reasons, only by
members of that religion, or by all persons. It is difficult to deny that a
law that prohibits religiously motivated conduct, even if the law is generally
applicable, does not at least implicate First Amendment concerns.


The Court responds that generally applicable laws are "one large step" removed
from laws aimed at specific religious practices. The First Amendment,
however, does not distinguish between laws that are generally applicable and
laws that target particular religious practices. Indeed, few States would be
so naive as to enact a law directly prohibiting or burdening a religious
practice as such. Our free exercise cases have all concerned generally
applicable laws that had the effect of significantly burdening a religious
practice. If the First Amendment is to have any vitality, it ought not be
construed to cover only the extreme and hypothetical situation in which a
State directly targets a religious practice. 

To say that a person's right to free exercise has been burdened, of course,
does not mean that he has an absolute right to engage in the conduct. Under
our established First Amendment jurisprudence, we have recognized that the
freedom to act, unlike the freedom to believe, cannot be absolute. Instead, we have respected
both the First Amendment's express textual mandate and the governmental
interest in regulation of conduct by requiring the government to justify any
substantial burden on religiously motivated conduct by a compelling state
interest and by means narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The compelling
interest test effectuates the First Amendment's command that religious liberty
is an independent liberty, that it occupies a preferred position, and that the
Court will not permit encroachments upon this liberty, whether direct or
indirect, unless required by clear and compelling governmental interests "of
the highest order." "Only
an especially important governmental interest pursued by narrowly tailored
means can justify exacting a sacrifice of First Amendment freedoms as the
price for an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by
other citizens."


Respondents, of course, do not contend that their conduct is automatically
immune from all governmental regulation simply because it is motivated by
their sincere religious beliefs. The Court's rejection of that argument might therefore be regarded as merely harmless dictum. Rather,
respondents invoke our traditional compelling interest test to argue that the
Free Exercise Clause requires the State to grant them a limited exemption from
its general criminal prohibition against the possession of peyote. The Court
today, however, denies them even the opportunity to make that argument,
concluding that "the sounder approach, and the approach in accord with the
vast majority of our precedents, is to hold the [compelling interest] test
inapplicable to" challenges to general criminal prohibitions. 

In my view, however, the essence of a free exercise claim is relief from a
burden imposed by government on religious practices or beliefs, whether the
burden is imposed directly through laws that prohibit or compel specific
religious practices, or indirectly through laws that, in effect, make
abandonment of one's own religion or conformity to the religious beliefs of
others the price of an equal place in the civil community. As we explained in Thomas:

> Where the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. 

[extensive discussion of caselaw, obviously reading it very differently from the majority]

The Court today gives no convincing reason to depart from settled First
Amendment jurisprudence. There is nothing talismanic about neutral laws of
general applicability or general criminal prohibitions, for laws neutral
toward religion can coerce a person to violate his religious conscience or
intrude upon his religious duties just as effectively as laws aimed at
religion. Although the Court suggests that the compelling interest test, as
applied to generally applicable laws, would result in a "constitutional
anomaly," the First Amendment unequivocally makes freedom of
religion, like freedom from race discrimination and freedom of speech, a
"constitutional nor[m]," not an "anomaly."  Nor would application of
our established free exercise doctrine to this case necessarily be
incompatible with our equal protection cases.  We
have in any event recognized that the Free Exercise Clause protects values
distinct from those protected by the Equal Protection Clause.  As the language of the Clause itself
makes clear, an individual's free exercise of religion is a preferred
constitutional activity.  A law that makes criminal such an activity therefore triggers
constitutional concern---and heightened judicial scrutiny even if it does not
target the particular religious conduct at issue. Our free speech cases
similarly recognize that neutral regulations that affect free speech values
are subject to a balancing, rather than categorical, approach. The Court's parade
of horribles not only fails as a reason for discarding
the compelling interest test, it instead demonstrates just the opposite: that
courts have been quite capable of applying our free exercise jurisprudence to
strike sensible balances between religious liberty and competing state
interests.

Finally, the Court today suggests that the disfavoring of minority religions
is an "unavoidable consequence" under our system of government and that
accommodation of such religions must be left to the political process.  In my view, however, the First Amendment was enacted precisely to
protect the rights of those whose religious practices are not shared by the
majority and may be viewed with hostility. The history of our free exercise
doctrine amply demonstrates the harsh impact majoritarian rule has had on
unpopular or emerging religious groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses and the
Amish. Indeed, the words of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Bd. of Ed.
v. Barnette are apt: "The very purpose of a Bill of
Rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political
controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to
establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. One's right to
life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship
and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they
depend on the outcome of no elections." 

The Court's holding today not only misreads settled First Amendment precedent;
it appears to be unnecessary to this case. I would reach the same result
applying our established free exercise jurisprudence.

There is no dispute that Oregon's criminal prohibition of peyote places a
severe burden on the ability of respondents to freely exercise their religion.
Peyote is a sacrament of the Native American Church and is regarded as vital
to respondents' ability to practice their religion. Under Oregon law, as construed by that State's highest court, members of the Native American Church must choose between carrying out
the ritual embodying their religious beliefs and avoidance of criminal
prosecution. That choice is, in my view, more than sufficient to trigger First
Amendment scrutiny.

There is also no dispute that Oregon has a significant interest in enforcing
laws that control the possession and use of controlled substances by its
citizens.  As we
recently noted, drug abuse is "one of the greatest problems affecting the
health and welfare of our population" and thus "one of the most serious
problems confronting our society today."  In light of our recent decisions
holding that the governmental interests in the collection of income tax, a comprehensive
Social Security system, and military conscription are compelling, respondents do not seriously dispute that Oregon has a compelling interest in prohibiting the possession of peyote by
its citizens.

Thus, the critical question in this case is whether exempting respondents from
the State's general criminal prohibition "will unduly interfere with
fulfillment of the governmental interest."  Although the question is close, I would conclude that
uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is "essential to
accomplish" its
overriding interest in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a
Schedule I controlled substance. Oregon's criminal prohibition represents that
State's judgment that the possession and use of controlled substances, even by
only one person, is inherently harmful and dangerous. Because the health
effects caused by the use of controlled substances exist regardless of the
motivation of the user, the use of such substances, even for religious
purposes, violates the very purpose of the laws that prohibit them. Moreover, in view of the societal interest in preventing trafficking
in controlled substances, uniform application of the criminal prohibition at
issue is essential to the effectiveness of Oregon's stated interest in
preventing any possession of peyote.

For these reasons, I believe that granting a selective exemption in this case
would seriously impair Oregon's compelling interest in prohibiting possession
of peyote by its citizens. Under such circumstances, the Free Exercise Clause
does not require the State to accommodate respondents' religiously motivated
conduct. 


**Justice BLACKMUN, with whom Justice BRENNAN and Justice MARSHALL join, dissenting.**

In weighing the clear interest of respondents Smith and Black (hereinafter respondents) in the free exercise of their religion against Oregon's asserted interest in enforcing its drug laws, it is important to articulate in precise terms the state interest involved. It is not the State's broad interest in fighting the critical "war on drugs" that must be weighed against respondents' claim, but the State's narrow interest in refusing to make an exception for the religious, ceremonial use of peyote. Failure to reduce the competing interests to the same plane of generality tends to distort the weighing process in the State's favor. 

The State's interest in enforcing its prohibition, in order to be sufficiently
compelling to outweigh a free exercise claim, cannot be merely abstract or
symbolic. The State cannot plausibly assert that unbending application of a
criminal prohibition is essential to fulfill any compelling interest, if it
does not, in fact, attempt to enforce that prohibition. In this case, the
State actually has not evinced any concrete interest in enforcing its drug
laws against religious users of peyote. Oregon has never sought to prosecute
respondents, and does not claim that it has made significant enforcement
efforts against other religious users of peyote. The State's asserted
interest thus amounts only to the symbolic preservation of an unenforced
prohibition. But a government interest in "symbolism, even symbolism for so
worthy a cause as the abolition of unlawful drugs," cannot suffice to abrogate the constitutional rights of individuals.

Similarly, this Court's prior decisions have not allowed a government to rely
on mere speculation about potential harms, but have demanded evidentiary
support for a refusal to allow a religious exception. In this case, the State's
justification for refusing to recognize an exception to its criminal laws for
religious peyote use is entirely speculative.

The State proclaims an interest in protecting the health and safety of its
citizens from the dangers of unlawful drugs. It offers, however, no evidence
that the religious use of peyote has ever harmed anyone. The factual findings
of other courts cast doubt on the State's assumption that religious use of
peyote is harmful. 

The fact that peyote is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance does
not, by itself, show that any and all uses of peyote, in any circumstance, are
inherently harmful and dangerous. The Federal Government, which created the
classifications of unlawful drugs from which Oregon's drug laws are derived,
apparently does not find peyote so dangerous as to preclude an exemption for
religious use. Moreover, other Schedule I drugs have lawful uses. 

The carefully circumscribed ritual context in which respondents used peyote is
far removed from the irresponsible and unrestricted recreational use of
unlawful drugs. The Native American Church's internal restrictions on, and
supervision of, its members' use of peyote substantially obviate the State's
health and safety concerns. 

The State also seeks to support its refusal to make an exception for religious
use of peyote by invoking its interest in abolishing drug trafficking. There
is, however, practically no illegal traffic in peyote. Also, the availability
of peyote for religious use, even if Oregon were to allow an exemption from
its criminal laws, would still be strictly controlled by federal regulations, and by the State
of Texas, the only State in which peyote grows in significant quantities.  Peyote simply is not a
popular drug; its distribution for use in religious rituals has nothing to do
with the vast and violent traffic in illegal narcotics that plagues this
country.

Finally, the State argues that granting an exception for religious peyote use
would erode its interest in the uniform, fair, and certain enforcement of its
drug laws. The State fears that, if it grants an exemption for religious
peyote use, a flood of other claims to religious exemptions will follow. It
would then be placed in a dilemma, it says, between allowing a patchwork of
exemptions that would hinder its law enforcement efforts, and risking a
violation of the Establishment Clause by arbitrarily limiting its religious
exemptions. This argument, however, could be made in almost any free exercise
case. See Lupu, Where Rights Begin: The Problem of Burdens on the Free
Exercise of Religion, 102 Harv.L.Rev. 933, 947 (1989) ("Behind every free
exercise claim is a spectral march; grant this one, a voice whispers to each
judge, and you will be confronted with an endless chain of exemption demands
from religious deviants of every stripe"). This Court, however, consistently
has rejected similar arguments in past free exercise cases, and it should do
so here as well.

The State's apprehension of a flood of other religious claims is purely
speculative. Almost half the States, and the Federal Government, have
maintained an exemption for religious peyote use for many years, and
apparently have not found themselves overwhelmed by claims to other religious
exemptions. Allowing an exemption for religious peyote use would not
necessarily oblige the State to grant a similar exemption to other religious
groups. The unusual circumstances that make the religious use of peyote
compatible with the State's interests in health and safety and in preventing
drug trafficking would not apply to other religious claims. Some religions,
for example, might not restrict drug use to a limited ceremonial context, as
does the Native American Church.  Some religious claims involve drugs such as marijuana and heroin, in which there is significant illegal traffic, with its attendant greed and violence, so that
it would be difficult to grant a religious exemption without seriously
compromising law enforcement efforts. That the State might grant an exemption
for religious peyote use, but deny other religious claims arising in different
circumstances, would not violate the Establishment Clause. Though the State
must treat all religions equally, and not favor one over another, this
obligation is fulfilled by the uniform application of the "compelling
interest" test to all free exercise claims, not by reaching uniform
results as to all claims.

Finally, although I agree with Justice O'CONNOR that courts should refrain
from delving into questions whether, as a matter of religious doctrine, a
particular practice is "central" to the religion, I do not
think this means that the courts must turn a blind eye to the severe impact of
a State's restrictions on the adherents of a minority religion.

Respondents believe, and their sincerity has _never_ been at issue, that the
peyote plant embodies their deity, and eating it is an act of worship and
communion. Without peyote, they could not enact the essential ritual of their
religion. 

If Oregon can constitutionally prosecute them for this act of worship, they,
like the Amish, may be "forced to migrate to some other and more tolerant
region." Yoder. This potentially
devastating impact must be viewed in light of the federal policy---reached in
reaction to many years of religious persecution and intolerance--of protecting
the religious freedom of Native Americans. See American Indian Religious
Freedom Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1996 ("[I]t shall be the
policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their
inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional
religions . . ., including but not limited to access to sites, use and
possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials
and traditional rites"). Congress recognized that certain substances, such
as peyote, "have religious significance because they are sacred, they have
power, they heal, they are necessary to the exercise of the rites of the
religion, they are necessary to the cultural integrity of the tribe, and,
therefore, religious survival." 

The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, in itself, may not create rights
enforceable against government action restricting religious freedom, but this
Court must scrupulously apply its free exercise analysis to the religious
claims of Native Americans, however unorthodox they may be. Otherwise, both
the First Amendment and the stated policy of Congress will offer to Native
Americans merely an unfulfilled and hollow promise.
