# The Establishment Clause

Ok, onto the Establishment clause. Here, the doctrine is a lot less clear. We know, of course, that the government can't establish an official church. But how much favoritism to religion can it show otherwise? Can we have "under God" in the pledge of allegiance? Can we give student loan money to religious schools? Can we have prayers before legislative sessions (and does it depend on who is allowed to give the prayer)? Can there be Christmas decorations on city hall?

## The Lemon test

The standard test for such things is known as the "Lemon Test," after Lemon v Kurtzman, 403 US 602 (1971). It specifies three conditions, all of which a law must meet to survive Establishment Clause scrutiny:

1.  The law must have a secular purpose.

2.  The law must not have a primary effect that either inhibits or advances religion.

3. The law must not "foster an excessive government entanglement with religion."

As you can probably tell from the nature of those standards, especially the third, this test can be a bit indeterminate. And it's also been subject to wide criticism. The good thing is that it inspired probably the single best Scalia tirade ever: in *Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District*, 508 U.S. 384 (1993), Nino had the following (only lightly edited) to say about the Lemon test:

> As to the Court's invocation of the Lemon test: like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave and shuffles abroad after being repeatedly killed and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence once again, frightening the little children and school attorneys of Center Moriches Union Free School District. Its most recent burial, only last Term, was, to be sure, not fully six-feet under: our decision in Lee v. Weisman, conspicuously avoided using the supposed "test," but also declined the invitation to repudiate it. Over the years, however, no fewer than five of the currently sitting Justices have, in their own opinions, personally driven pencils through the creature's heart (the author of today's opinion repeatedly), and a sixth has joined an opinion doing so. 

> The secret of the Lemon test's survival, I think, is that it is so easy to kill. It is there to scare us (and our audience) when we wish it to do so, but we can command it to return to the tomb at will. When we wish to strike down a practice it forbids, we invoke it, see, e.g., Aguilar v. Fenton (striking down state remedial education program administered in part in parochial schools); when we wish to uphold a practice it forbids, we ignore it entirely, see Marsh v. Chambers (upholding state legislative chaplains). Sometimes, we take a middle course, calling its three prongs "no more than helpful signposts," Hunt v. McNair. Such a docile and useful monster is worth keeping around, at least in a somnolent state; one never knows when one might need him. 

> For my part, I agree with the long list of constitutional scholars who have criticized Lemon and bemoaned the strange Establishment Clause geometry of crooked lines and wavering shapes its intermittent use has produced. I will decline to apply Lemon -- whether it validates or invalidates the government action in question -- and therefore cannot Join the opinion of the Court today.

I do miss Scalia.^[Also, one of my greatest pedagogical achievements to date was finding a way to teach that case on Halloween. Suck it, *Stambovsky v Ackley*.]

So what does this geometry of crooked lines and wavering shapes actually work out to mean? Really, the only way to get a solid sense of it is to read a whole bunch of cases. But since we don't have time for that, I'm going to hammer through some examples in list form.

- Tax exemptions for churches: permissible. *Waltz v. Tax Commission of New York*, 397 U.S. 664 (1970) BUT: maybe tax exemptions for publishing wings of churches not ok? *Texas Monthly v. Bullock*, 489 U.S. 1 (1989) (plurality).

- Government giving money to religious institutions earmarked for secular purposes (e.g. sending math books to religious schools): sometimes ok, sometimes not ok on the entanglement prong of the Lemon test, because then government would have to go in and monitor the use of that money, start meddling in the internal operations of the church, etc. But there are lots of cases going different ways on this. Some of the struggle can be seen in *Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen*, 392 US 236 (1968).

- It's clear that the state can't pay religious school teacher salaries, at least (this is Lemon itself), and can't let them come into public schools to teach religion, *McCollum v. Board of Education*, 333 U.S. 203 (1948).

- Speaking of schools (one of the huge issues): school prayer, not ok if it's set up by school, even if students can opt out. *Wallace v. Jaffree*, 472 U.S. 38 (1985). Not even at graduation. *Lee v. Weisman*, 505 US 577 (1992).

- But school vouchers, even when they direct funds to religious schools, are ok. *Zelman v. Simmons-Harris*, 536 US 639 (2002). From Rehnquist's majority opinion:

> where a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause. A program that shares these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits

- There's also a question of the extent to which government can fund religious groups on the same terms as nonreligious groups. *Rosenberger v. University of Virginia*, 515 U.S. 819 (1995), said that it can, and that failing to do so would actually be an impermissible content-based restriction on speech! (How is that reconcilable with *Rust v. Sullivan*, you might ask? Good question. Ask a justice.)

- Similarly, *Capitol Square Review Board v. Pinette*, 515 US 753 (1995): impermissible content-based discrimination to refuse to permit a private group to erect a cross in town square, even on the basis that permitting it would be an establishment clause violation. Incidentally, the real issue here wasn't religion. If you go look at the case, you'll see that the people who wanted to erect the cross were the KKK. One imagines they intended to burn it.

- Legislative prayer: ok, mainly because it's an old tradition. *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983)

- Finally, public-provided religious monuments on public property. Ten commandments in the courthouse, nativity scene in city hall. That's the subject of one of our cases in this area, *McCreary County v. ACLU*. We'll focus on the application of the Lemon Test here to try to make sense of it.

## Theoretical foundations

Generally, we might describe at least four broad ideas, all of which are constantly battling, and none of which has won (although the last has clearly lost, despite Scalia's urge for it to win):

"Wall of separation": Jefferson.

Neutrality1: can't promote religion over secularism

Neutrality2: can promote religion generally, so long as it is noncoercive/doesn't actually establish a church. Can't promote one religion over others.

Can't establish an official church. Can do whatever else. Something like the Scalia view.

The theoretical ideas running underneath those views are also contested. Some say the point is to protect religion from state corruption. Some say the point is to protect the state from religious corruption. And some say the point is to permit a healthy diversity of religions. Me? I dunno. So that's really what I've got on that. Highly indeterminate doctrine, lots of mess.
