# Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer

343 U.S. 579 (1952)

**Mr. Justice BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.**

We are asked to decide whether the President was acting within his
constitutional power when he issued an order directing the Secretary of
Commerce to take possession of and operate most of the Nation's steel mills.
The mill owners argue that the President's order amounts to lawmaking, a
legislative function which the Constitution has expressly confided to the
Congress and not to the President. The Government's position is that the order
was made on findings of the President that his action was necessary to avert a
national catastrophe which would inevitably result from a stoppage of steel
production, and that in meeting this grave emergency the President was acting
within the aggregate of his constitutional powers as the Nation's Chief
Executive and the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States.
The issue emerges here from the following series of events:

In the latter part of 1951, a dispute arose between the steel companies and
their employees over terms and conditions that should be included in new
collective bargaining agreements. Long-continued conferences failed to resolve
the dispute. On December 18, 1951, the employees' representative, United
Steelworkers of America, C.I.O., gave notice of an intention to strike when
the existing bargaining agreements expired on December 31. The Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service then intervened in an effort to get labor
and management to agree. This failing, the President on December 22, 1951,
referred the dispute to the Federal Wage Stabilization Board to investigate
and make recommendations for fair and equitable terms of settlement. This
Board's report resulted in no settlement. On April 4, 1952, the Union gave
notice of a nation-wide strike called to begin at 12:01 a.m. April 9. The
indispensability of steel as a component of substantially all weapons and
other war materials led the President to believe that the proposed work
stoppage would immediately jeopardize our national defense and that
governmental seizure of the steel mills was necessary in order to assure the
continued availability of steel. Reciting these considerations for his action,
the President, a few hours before the strike was to begin, issued Executive
Order 10340.
The order directed the Secretary of Commerce to take possession of most of the
steel mills and keep them running. The Secretary immediately issued his own
possessory orders, calling upon the presidents of the various seized companies
to serve as operationg managers for the United States. They were directed to
carry on their activities in accordance with regulations and directions of the
Secretary. The next morning the President sent a message to Congress reporting
his action.  Twelve days later he sent a
second message. Congress has taken no
action.

Obeying the Secretary's orders under protest, the companies brought
proceedings against him in the District Court. Their complaints charged that
the seizure was not authorized by an act of Congress or by any constitutional
provisions. The District Court was asked to declare the orders of the
President and the Secretary invalid and to issue preliminary and permanent
injunctions restraining their enforcement. Opposing the motion for preliminary
injunction, the United States asserted that a strike disrupting steel
production for even a brief period would so endanger the well-being and safety
of the Nation that the President had 'inherent power' to do what he had done--
power 'supported by the Constitution, by historical precedent, and by court
decisions.' 

The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act
of Congress or from the Constitution itself. There is no statute that
expressly authorizes the President to take possession of property as he did
here. Nor is there any act of Congress to which our attention has been
directed from which such a power can fairly be implied. Indeed, we do not
understand the Government to rely on statutory authorization for this seizure.
There are two statutes which do authorize the President to take both personal
and real property under certain conditions. However, the Government admits
that these conditions were not met and that the President's order was not
rooted in either of the statutes. The Government refers to the seizure
provisions of one of these statutes (§ 201(b) of the Defense Production Act)
as 'much too cumbersome, involved, and time-consuming for the crisis which was
at hand.'

Moreover, the use of the seizure technique to solve labor disputes in order to
prevent work stoppages was not only unauthorized by any congressional
enactment; prior to this controversy, Congress had refused to adopt that
method of settling labor disputes. When the Taft-Hartley Act was under
consideration in 1947, Congress rejected an amendment which would have
authorized such governmental seizures in cases of emergency. Apparently it
was thought that the technique of seizure, like that of compulsory
arbitration, would interfere with the process of collective bargaining.
Consequently, the plan Congress adopted in that Act did not provide for
seizure under any circumstances. Instead, the plan sought to bring about
settlements by use of the customary devices of mediation, conciliation,
investigation by boards of inquiry, and public reports. In some instances
temporary injunctions were authorized to provide cooling-off periods. All this
failing, unions were left free to strike after a secret vote by employees as
to whether they wished to accept their employers' final settlement offer.

It is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did, it
must be found in some provisions of the Constitution. And it is not claimed
that express constitutional language grants this power to the President. The
contention is that presidential power should be implied from the aggregate of
his powers under the Constitution. Particular reliance is placed on provisions
in Article II which say that 'the executive Power shall be vested in a
President'; that 'he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed'; and that he 'shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of
the United States.'

The order cannot properly be sustained as an exercise of the President's
military power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. The Government
attempts to do so by citing a number of cases upholding broad powers in
military commanders engaged in day-to-day fighting in a theater of war. Such
cases need not concern us here. Even though 'theater of war' be an expanding
concept, we cannot with faithfulness to our constitutional system hold that
the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces has the ultimate power as such to
take possession of private property in order to keep labor disputes from
stopping production. This is a job for the Nation's lawmakers, not for its
military authorities.

Nor can the seizure order be sustained because of the several constitutional
provisions that grant executive power to the President. In the framework of
our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are faithfully
executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits
his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he tninks
wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither
silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to
execute. The first section of the first article says that 'All legislative
Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.' After granting many powers to the Congress, Article I goes on to provide
that Congress may 'make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for
carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers and all other Powers vested by
this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department
or Officer thereof.'


The President's order does not direct that a congressional policy be executed
in a manner prescribed by Congress--it directs that a presidential policy be
executed in a manner prescribed by the President. The preamble of the order
itself, like that of many statutes, sets out reasons why the President
believes certain policies should be adopted, proclaims these policies as rules
of conduct to be followed, and again, like a statute, authorizes a government
official to promulgate additional rules and regulations consistent with the
policy proclaimed and needed to carry that policy into execution. The power of
Congress to adopt such public policies as those proclaimed by the order is
beyond question. It can authorize the taking of private property for public
use. It can makes laws regulating the relationships between employers and
employees, prescribing rules designed to settle labor disputes, and fixing
wages and working conditions in certain fields of our economy. The
Constitution did not subject this law-making power of Congress to presidential
or military supervision or control.


It is said that other Presidents without congressional authority have taken
possession of private business enterprises in order to settle labor disputes.
But even if this be true, Congress has not thereby lost its exclusive
constitutional authority to make laws necessary and proper to carry out the
powers vested by the Constitution 'in the Government of the United States, or
in any Department or Officer thereof.'


The Founders of this Nation entrusted the law making power to the Congress
alone in both good and bad times. It would do no good to recall the historical
events, the fears of power and the hopes for freedom that lay behind their
choice. Such a review would but confirm our holding that this seizure order
cannot stand.

The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.


**Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER, concurring.**


The question before the Court comes in this setting. Congress has frequently--
at least 16 times since 1916-- specifically provided for executive seizure of
production, transportation, communications, or storage facilities. In every
case it has qualified this grant of power with limitations and safeguards.
This body of enactments demonstrates that Congress deemed seizure so drastic a power as to require
that it be carefully circumscribed whenever the President was vested with this
extraordinary authority. The power to seize has uniformly been given only for
a limited period or for a defined emergency, or has been repealed after a
short period. Its exercise has been restricted to particular circumstances
such as 'time of war or when was is imminent,' the needs of 'public safety' or
of 'national security or defense,' or 'urgent and impending need.' The period
of governmental operation has been limited, as, for instance, to 'sixty days
after the restoration of productive efficiency.' Seizure statutes usually make
executive action dependent on detailed conditions: for example, (a) failure or
refusal of the owner of a plant to meet governmental supply needs or (b)
failure of voluntary negotiations with the owner for the use of a plant
necessary for great public ends. Congress often has specified the particular
executive agency which should seize or operate the plants or whose judgment
would appropriately test the need for seizure. Congress also has not left to
implication that just compensation be paid: it has usually legislated in
detail regarding enforcement of this litigation-breeding general requirement.

Congress in 1947 was again called upon to consider whether governmental
seizure should be used to avoid serious industrial shutdowns. Congress decided
against conferring such power generally and in advance, without special
congressional enactment to meet each particular need. Under the urgency of
telephone and coal strikes in the winter of 1946, Congress addressed itself to
the problems raised by 'national emergency' strikes and lockouts. The
termination of wartime seizure powers on December 31, 1946, brought these
matters to the attention of Congress with vivid impact. A proposal that the
President be given powers to seize plants to avert a shutdown where the
'health or safety' of the nation was endangered, was thoroughly canvassed by
Congress and rejected. 

In any event, nothing can be plainer than that Congress made a conscious
choice of policy in a field full of perplexity and peculiarly within
legislative responsibility for choice. In formulating legislation for dealing
with industrial conflicts, Congress could not more clearly and emphatically
have withheld authority than it did in 1947. Perhaps as much so as is true of
any piece of modern legislation, Congress acted with full consciousness of
what it was doing and in the light of much recent history. Previous seizure
legislation had subjected the powers granted to the President to restrictions
of varying degrees of stringency. Instead of giving him even limited powers,
Congress in 1947 deemed it wise to require the President, upon failure of
attempts to reach a voluntary settlement, to report to Congress if he deemed
the power of seizure a needed shot for his locker. The President could not
ignore the specific limitations of prior seizure statutes. No more could he
act in disregard of the limitation put upon seizure by the 1947 Act.

It cannot be contended that the President would have had power to issue this
order had Congress explicitly negated such authority in formal legislation.
Congress has expressed its will to withhold this power from the President as
though it had said so in so many words. The authoritatively expressed purpose
of Congress to disallow such power to the President and to require him, when
in his mind the occasion arose for such a seizure, to put the matter to
Congress and ask for specific authority from it, could not be more decisive if
it had been written into §§ 206--210 of the Labor Management Relations Act of
1947. 


**Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, concurring.**


There can be no doubt that the emergency which caused the President to seize
these steel plants was one that bore heavily on the country. But the emergency
did not create power; it merely marked an occasion when power should be
exercised. And the fact that it was necessary that measures be taken to keep
steel in production does not mean that the President, rather than the
Congress, had the constitutional authority to act. The Congress, as well as
the President, is trustee of the national welfare. The President can act more
quickly than the Congress. The President with the armed services at his
disposal can move with force as well as with speed. All executive power--from
the reign of ancient kings to the rule of modern dictators--has the outward
appearance of efficiency.

Legislative power, by contrast, is slower to exercise. There must be delay
while the ponderous machinery of committees, hearings, and debates is put into
motion. That takes time; and while the Congress slowly moves into action, the
emergency may take its toll in wages, consumer goods, war production, the
standard of living of the people, and perhaps even lives. Legislative action
may indeed often be cumbersome, time-consuming, and apparently inefficient.
But as Mr. Justice Brandeis stated in his dissent in Myers v. United States:

> The doctrine of the separation of powers was adopted by the Convention of 1787 not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of the governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy.' 

We therefore cannot decide this case by determining which branch of government can deal most expeditiously with the present crisis. The answer must depend on the allocation of powers under the Constitution. That in turn requires an analysis of the conditions giving rise to the seizure and of the seizure itself.

The relations between labor and industry are one of the crucial problems of
the era. Their solution will doubtless entail many methods--education of labor
leaders and business executives; the encouragement of mediation and
conciliation by the President and the use of his great office in the cause of
industrial peace; and the passage of laws. Laws entail sanctions--penalties
for their violation. One type of sanction is find and imprisonment. Another is
seizure of property. An industry may become so lawless, so irresponsible as to
endanger the whole economy. Seizure of the industry may be the only wise and
practical solution.

The method by which industrial peace is achieved is of vital importance not
only to the parties but to society as well. A determination that sanctions
should be applied, that the hand of the law should be placed upon the parties,
and that the force of the courts should be directed against them, is an
exercise of legislative power. In some nations that power is entrusted to the
executive branch as a matter of course or in case of emergencies. We chose
another course. We chose to place the legislative power of the Federal
Government in the Congress. The language of the Constitution is not ambiguous
or qualified. It places not some legislative power in the Congress; Article I,
Section 1 says 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of
Representatives.'

The legislative nature of the action taken by the President seems to me to be
clear. When the United States takes over an industrial plant to settle a labor
controversy, it is condemning property. The seizure of the plant is a taking
in the constitutional sense. A permanent taking would amount to the
nationalization of the industry. A temporary taking falls short of that goal.
But though the seizure is only for a week or a month, the condemnation is
complete and the United States must pay compensation for the temporary
possession. 

The power of the Federal Government to condemn property is well established. It can condemn for any public purpose; and I have no doubt but that condemnation of a plant, factory, or industry in order to promote industrial peace would be constitutional. But
there is a duty to pay for all property taken by the Government. The command
of the Fifth Amendment is that no 'private property be taken for public use,
without just compensation. That constitutional requirement has an important
bearing on the present case.

The President has no power to raise reveunes. That power is in the Congress by
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The President might seize and the
Congress by subsequent action might ratify the seizure. But until and unless
Congress acted, no condemnation would be lawful. The branch of government that
has the power to pay compensation for a seizure is the only one able to
authorize a seizure or make lawful one that the President had effected. That
seems to me to be the necessary result of the condemnation provision in the
Fifth Amendment. It squares with the theory of checks and balances expounded
by Mr. Justice BLACK in the opinion of the Court in which I Join.

If we sanctioned the present exercise of power by the President, we would be
expanding Article II of the Constitution and rewriting it to suit the
political conveniences of the present emergency. Article II which vests the
'executive Power' in the President defines that power with particularity.
Article II, Section 2 makes the Chief Executive the Commander in Chief of the
Army and Navy. But our history and tradition rebel at the thought that the
grant of military power carries with it authority over civilian affairs.
Article II, Section 3 provides that the President shall 'from time to time
give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to
their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.'
The power to recommend legislation, granted to the President, serves only to
emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of
the Congress to legislate. Article II, Section 3, also provides that the
President 'shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.' But as Mr.
Justice BLACK and Mr. Justice FRANKFURTER point out the power to execute the
laws starts and ends with the laws Congress has enacted.

**Mr. Justice JACKSON, concurring in the judgment and opinion of the court.**

A judge, like an executive adviser, may be surprised at the poverty of really
useful and unambiguous authority applicable to concrete problems of executive
power as they actually present themselves. Just what our forefathers did
envision, or would have envisioned had they foreseen modern conditions, must
be divined from materials almost as enigmatic as the dreams Joseph was called
upon to interpret for Pharaoh. A century and a half of partisan debate and
scholarly speculation yields no net result but only supplies more or less apt
quotations from respected sources on each side of any question. They largely
cancel each other. And court decisions are indecisive because of the judicial
practice of dealing with the largest questions in the most narrow way.

The actual art of governing under our Constitution does not and cannot conform
to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated
clauses or even single Articles torn from context. While the Constitution
diffuses power the better to secure liberty, it also contemplates that
practice will integrate the dispersed powers into a workable government. It
enjoins upon its branches separateness but interdependence, autonomy but
reciprocity. Presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate, depending upon
their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress. We may well begin by
a somewhat over-simplified grouping of practical situations in which a
President may doubt, or others may challenge, his powers, and by
distinguishing roughly the legal consequences of this factor of relativity.

1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of
Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he
possesses in his own right plus all that Congress can delegate. In these
circumstances, and in these only, may he be said (for what it may be worth),
to personify the federal sovereignty. If his act is held unconstitutional
under these circumstances, it usually means that the Federal Government as an
undivided whole lacks power. A seizure executed by the President pursuant to
an Act of Congress would be supported by the strongest of presumptions and the
widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion would
rest heavily upon any who might attack it.

2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional grant or
denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent powers, but
there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent
authority, or in which its distribution is uncertain. Therefore, congressional
inertia, indifference or quiescence may sometimes, at least as a practical
matter, enable, if not invite, measures on independent presidential
responsibility. In this area, any actual test of power is likely to depend on
the imperatives of events and contemporary imponderables rather than on
abstract theories of law.


3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or
implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb, for then he can rely
only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of
Congress over the matter. Courts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in
such a case only be disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject.
Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be
scrutinized with caution, for what is at stake is the equilibruim established
by our constitutional system.

Into which of these classifications does this executive seizure of the steel
industry fit? It is eliminated from the first by admission, for it is conceded
that no congressional authorization exists for this seizure. 

Can it then be defended under flexible tests available to the second category?
It seems clearly eliminated from that class because Congress has not left
seizure of private property an open field but has covered it by three
statutory policies inconsistent with this seizure. In cases where the purpose
is to supply needs of the Government itself, two courses are provided: one,
seizure of a plant which fails to comply with obligatory orders placed by the
Government, another, condemnation of facilities, including temporary use
under the power of eminent domain. The third is applicable where it is the
general economy of the country that is to be protected rather than exclusive
governmental interests. None of these were invoked. In choosing a different
and inconsistent way of his own, the President cannot claim that it is
necessitated or invited by failure of Congress to legislate upon the
occasions, grounds and methods for seizure of industrial properties.

This leaves the current seizure to be justified only by the severe tests under
the third grouping, where it can be supported only by any remainder of
executive power after subtraction of such powers as Congress may have over the
subject. In short, we can sustain the President only by holding that seizure
of such strike-bound industries is within his domain and beyond control by
Congress. Thus, this Court's first review of such seizures occurs under
circumstances which leave Presidential power most vulnerable to attack and in
the least favorable of possible constitutional postures.

The Solicitor General seeks the power of seizure in three clauses of the
Executive Article, the first reading, 'The executive Power shall be vested in
a President of the United States of America.' Lest I be thought to exaggerate,
I quote the interpretation which his brief puts upon it: 'In our view, this
clause constitutes a grant of all the executive powers of which the Government
is capable.' If that be true, it is difficult to see why the forefathers
bothered to add several specific items, including some trifling ones.

The example of such unlimited executive power that must have most impressed
the forefathers was the prerogative exercised by George III, and the
description of its evils in the Declaration of Independence leads me to doubt
that they were creating their new Executive in his image. Continental European
examples were no more appealing. And if we seek instruction from our own
times, we can match it only from the executive powers in those governments we
disparagingly describe as totalitarian. I cannot accept the view that this
clause is a grant in bulk of all conceivable executive power but regard it as
an allocation to the presidential office of the generic powers thereafter
stated.
