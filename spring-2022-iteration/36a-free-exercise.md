Free Exercise

## Is there a tension between Free Exercise and Establishment?

So the first thing to notice about the religion clause of the First Amendment is, of course, that it's actually two clauses, free exercise and establishment. And it has, accordingly, spawned two different doctrinal lines.

I'd like to start with a hypo that highlights the difficult issues between the two clauses. Should the government give exceptions to the military draft for people with religious objections to serving? Here's one thing you might think about this. The First Amendment forbids Congress from prohibiting the free exercise of religion. If I'm a Quaker, the free exercise of my religion means pacifism. If Congress throws me in the slammer for refusing to do violence, it's prohibited the free exercise of my religion. Unconstitutional.

But here's another thing you might think. There's also the establishment clause. And (I'll give you a sneak preview) we know the establishment clause doesn't just mean that Congress can't set up a national church, like the Church of England (the strict concept of an "established church"). Typically, we think that the Establishment clause at a minimum requires the government to be religiously neutral, not to prefer some religions to others (or to nonreligion altogether). Providing special privileges to a handful of religions, that's not neutral! Draft exemption for the Quakers? Unconstitutional!

Obviously, those two views can't both be right, as they contradict one another. But it's something the Court and scholars have struggled with. What can we do about it?

Yet the Framers didn't think the two clauses were in tension with one another. The classic founding-era document about the relationship between Establishment and Free Exercise is James Madison's "Memorial and Remonstrance," where he scolded the Virginia legislature for proposing to use tax dollars to support teachers of religion. Let's just say Madison was not happy with this proposal; at one point he went so far as to call it "an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation"(!!!!)

Most importantly, however, he made absolutely clear that he saw such an establishment of religion as an infringement of free exercise as well, because the underlying idea underneath the two, treating adherents to different religions equally, was violated. Here's Madison:

> [T]he proposed establishment is a departure from that generous policy, which, offering an Asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every Nation and Religion, promised a lustre to our country, and an accession to the number of its citizens. What a melancholy mark is the Bill of sudden degeneracy? Instead of holding forth an Asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree.

Madison said that, note, about the mere provision of public funding for religious instruction. So it will be profitable to us to think about the religion clauses in that light. Of course, "profitable" is not the same as "conclusive," because people who prefer to read the Establishment clause as of narrower scope have lots of other founding-era documents to point to. But I like the Remonstrance.

Ok, enough of that, let's hammer through some doctrine. 


## Free Exercise doctrine basics

Most of the doctrine here is actually pretty simple and straightforward, but it also has changed, and so you need some history. 

First, a basic proposition: everybody agrees that the government can't target religion. "The Catholic Church is banned." Not constitutional. Likewise, the government can't target religious practice as such. "No communion wine." Not cool. 

But the real question is the one I gave you a minute ago in the hypo: the extent to which the government can make believers obey generally applicable laws that conflict with their faith. That is, does religion provide an exemption to laws that are not targeted against religious practice?

### The old doctrine: some accommodations

In the middle of the 20th century, we had a bunch of cases which might lead one to suspect that the government is obliged to provide people of faith exemptions to generally applicable laws, or at least to meet some kind of heightened scrutiny if it wants to do so. 

For example, in *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, 406 US 205 (1972), the Court held that the state could not force Amish parents to send their children to school beyond age 14 pursuant to a generally applicable law requiring such schooling. The Court applied some unclear kind of heightened scrutiny to carve out a religious exemption to the law, holding that "in order for Wisconsin to compel school attendance beyond the eighth grade against a claim that such attendance interferes with the practice of a legitimate religious belief, it must appear either that the State does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by its requirement or that there is a state interest of sufficient magnitude to override the interest claiming protection under the Free Exercise Clause." Moreover, the Court quite explicitly made clear that the law's general applicability would not save it (at least from an as-applied challenge):

> Nor can this case be disposed of on the grounds that Wisconsin's requirement for school attendance to age 16 applies uniformly to all citizens of the State and does not, on its face, discriminate against religions or a particular religion, or that it is motivated by legitimate secular concerns. A regulation neutral on its face may, in its application, nonetheless offend the constitutional requirement for governmental neutrality if it unduly burdens the free exercise of religion.

Earlier, in *Sherbet v. Verner*, 374 U.S. 398 (1963), the other landmark case along these lines, the Court upheld the claim to unemployment compensation of a Seventh-Day Adventist who was fired for refusing to work on her Saturday sabbath. Reversing the underlying ruling denying her benefits, the Court said:

> [N]ot only is it apparent that appellant's declared ineligibility for benefits derives solely from the practice of her religion, but the pressure upon her to forego that practice is unmistakable. The ruling forces her to choose between following the precepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the other hand. Governmental imposition of such a choice puts the same kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion as would a fine imposed against appellant for her Saturday worship.

Moreover, the Court stated a standard that sounded quite a lot like strict scrutiny for legal burdens on religious practice.

### The modern doctrine: no accommodations

*Employment Division v. Smith* changed all that: now, governmental intrusions on religious practice via generally applicable law get rational basis. Needless to say, I want you to look at what the Court does with Yoder and Sherbert and ponder questions like "how much of those cases survive," and "what is the actual justification for this decision?"

So is that it? Is the free exercise clause dead? Well, no, for two reasons. First, as noted, everyone agrees that the government can't target religious practice. And every once in a while the government is dumb enough to do so. *Lukumi Babalu Aye* is really a hillariously easy case on this respect---there's a reason it was 9-0 in the court. Hopefully the city fired its lawyers. If you ever write a bill so stupidly drafted I'm going to personally come and take your law degree back, and I'm going to turn it over to Leonidas wrapped around a scratching post.^[Believe it or not, that is actually only the *second-dumbest* law to show up in a Supreme Court First Amendment case.  Check out *Board of Airport Commissioners of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.*, 482 U.S. 569 (1987), where the airport people enacted a regulation prohibiting--- wait for it --- all "First Amendment activities."  **Important legal career hint**: if you write a law that actually describes the activity you're prohibiting in terms of the very Constitutional provision that says you can't prohibit it, that law is going to be struck down.]

The second issue is "but wait a minute, Gowder, didn't we just have the Hobby Lobby case?" Indeed, I've even assigned the Hobby Lobby case to you. And if you haven't been living in a cave for the last few years, you might know that Hobby Lobby was a challenge to a generally applicable law, namely, the requirement that employers provide contraception insurance, on the basis of a religious objection. So what's the dealio with that?

### RFRA

Well, the dealio with that is that Congress didn't like *Employment Division v. Smith*. So it passed a law known as the "Religious Freedom Restoration Act" (RFRA) which attempted to legislatively override the Smith, subjecting generally applicable laws that burden religion to strict scrutiny. 

Congress tried to apply RFRA to the states as well as the federal government, but the Court in *City of Boerne v. Flores*, held that the application to the states was beyond Congress's enumerated powers. (We'll read that later.)

But RFRA still applies to the federal government.^[Of course, if you're a sensible type, you might ask "sure, I can see how it applies to things like federal regulations, but can it really apply to Acts of Congress? Isn't there a basic rule of law that says that later enactments implicitly repeal earlier enactments to the extent they conflict, such that the RFRA can't be applied to, oh, say, Obamacare?" See e.g. *Credit Suisse v. Billing*, 551 U.S. 264 (2007). My answer to this objection is: "you'd think so, wouldn't you? Ask a justice, not me." This has actually been the object of substantial discussion in the con law community. One way to possibly resolve the problem is just to treat RFRA as giving the courts a strong presumption on how later laws are to be interpreted, and hence forbidding *implicit* repeal while still, obviously, permitting explicit repeal or carve-out.] So that's where the law is right now. When you read Hobby Lobby, I'd like you to focus primarily on two things, first, figuring out the notion of what a burden on religious exercise is, and second, figuring out what the corporate, and more generally economic, function of the challenger plays in the decision.

## No judicial theology

One other big and important point that I want to mention about the Free Exercise clause as well as statutory religious exemptions: one thing the Courts clearly can't do is interpret people's beliefs for them. If you're a Catholic, and you think your religion forbids eating meat, and somehow this has become legally relevant, the Court can't say "actually, the Pope's encyclical number X clearly says that bacon is yummy, so this doesn't burden your religion." 

Similarly, the courts cannot, obviously, make rulings about the truth or falsity of religious belief, an issue that comes up particularly when religions claim things that might have real-world impact, like a belief in faith healing or fortune-telling. 

Finally, courts will often decline to get involved in internal church disputes, even when those disputes touch on issues of general law; for example, there are cases where the courts have refused to adjudicate property disputes between a church and a splinter group. 

But what courts can and do do is judge the sincerity of a litigant's religious belief. This comes up a lot when people cook up frivolous religious claims to get out of obligations they don't like.  ("I'm a Quaker, honest, don't send me to war!") Prisoners are notorious for inventing the Church of Free Steak and Whiskey and filing lawsuits claiming that the prisons are obliged to feed them thusly, but, of course, they don't actually hold those beliefs and the Court can recognize that fact.

## IS ANY OF THIS TRUE ANY MORE??

Well, maybe.  As Fulton indicates, there are at least 3 justices who flat-out want to overrule Smith, and a fourth (Barrett) who is strongly leaning toward the idea.  We'll see what happens when someone gives the court a case that Roberts and Barrett can't dispose of without doing so.  A lot of the impetus for this really came from the covid cases---as the Alito opinion in Fulton hints, we've seen a *lot* of cases where churches successfully challenged stay-at-home orders during covid, universally on the argument that the laws weren't neutral under Lukumi because other secular activities like going to the grocery store were permitted.^[This seems to me a strained application of Lukumi, because we damn well know the motivations of the religious bigots running the city of Hialeah, whereas by contrast it's pretty hard to believe that people like Andrew Cuomo, for all their flaws, were bent on persecuting Christians. But Alito's points about the difficulty of figuring out comparators really come out in thinking about those cases.]
