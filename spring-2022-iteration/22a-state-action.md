# State Action

Let's start with a basic point about the constitution: it only constrains the government. Your private employer can fire you for speech, your landlord could (except for the fact that we have anti-discrimination statutes) evict you because she doesn't like your religion or race, and so forth.

... or can they?

There's one fundamental question about this conventional state action requirement. Doesn't the state enable private action? After all, private rights, particularly private economic rights, tend to be enforced by state agents with guns. 

So suppose there aren't laws prohibiting discrimination in commercial environments. A member of a racial minority group is in a shopping mall, and the owner decides that she or he doesn't want members of that racial group in the place. So the racist owner orders the customer to leave. If the customer says "no," the owner picks up the phone and calls the police, and it becomes the obligation of the police to enforce the owner's property rights by evicting the trespasser. Is the state thereby *implicated* in the racial discrimination? *Are the cops allowed to carry out the racist property-rights enforcement?*^[Even if the owner uses private security, it's the state's laws that give those private security guards a defense against the battery claim for kicking the customer out, and there's also a concern that the owner is thereby taking on a state function. Surely, for example, a city couldn't get away with racist policing just by abolishing its own police department and letting private rich people who just happened to be racists do all the police work.]

So what do we do about this? Well, for the most part, we don't do much. But occasionally we do something. The leading case in applying constitutional constraints to the private invocation of government power, of course, is Shelley v. Kraemer, which we'll be reading (and which you may have already read in property class). When you read it, I want you to keep an eye out for what makes the case special. Given that we don't normally apply constitutional law to bar private use of general rules of law, even to satisfy preferences that would be unconstitutional if the government did it, what is it about Shelley that led to a different result?

But it's appeared elsewhere too. In the First Amendment context, we had Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501 (1946), which forbade the state from enforcing criminal trespass rules to backstop the owner of a company town's prohibition on distributing literature on its sidewalks, essentially on the theory that the public forum carried with it First Amendment interests regardless of whether it was private or public property. For a while, it looked like this was going to be a much broader doctrine, especially in Amalgamated Food Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U.S. 308 (1968) (trespass laws could not be used to prohibit union members from picketing shopping center). However, in Lloyd Corporation v. Tanner, 407 US 551 (1972), and Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507 (1976) the Court killed off Logan Valley (distinguishing it in the former, explicitly overruling it in the latter) and made it clear that it would only apply this kind of first-amendment-on-private-property doctrine to actual company towns, that is, limited to the facts of Marsh.

That being said, the Logan Valley idea has had something of a resurgence in a handful of states, which have found a right rooted in the free speech (or sometimes petition or elections) clauses in their state constitutions to speak to others on private property like malls that has taken on some of the attributes of the traditional public forum (the idea here is kind of like a marketplace, a big gathering area where one's fellow citizens can be found). In Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980), the Supreme Court upheld the California Supreme's court extensions of free speech rights to privately owned shopping centers against a challenge from the shopping center owner claiming that it was either a taking or compelled speech.

The rule of New York Times v. Sullivan is also an example of an loosening of the state action principle. We've mentioned this case before, but not read it, to remind you, it's a doctrine holding that public figures cannot prevail on defamation claims (or similar torts) unless they can show "actual malice," which, recall, has nothing to do with malice but means they need to be able to show defendant knew that the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity. This is the same kind of idea as in Marsh: we won't let certain categories of plaintiffs make use of the general principles of tort, contract, or property law, because their application would involve the government too closely in threatening important constitutional interests. Interestingly, the NYT v. Sullivan doctrine started out applying to public officials, which makes much more sense in terms of the state action requirement, but then ended up applying to "public figures" more broadly, Taylor Swift in addition to Barack Obama.^[Memo to defamation plaintiffs: shake, shake, shake it off.]

The other major area where we apply constitutional rights directly to private economic arrangements is a doctrine you may remember from contracts: no specific performance of personal services contracts, because that's rather too much like slavery. Which makes specific sense in the context of the 13th amendment, which, of course, was intended to abolish a particular kind of private property and contract arrangement. There's no big salient case here, but the lower courts recite this all the time, and it's been an object of a certain amount of scholarly discussion.

# Exercise: Noncompete

A sizable local computer technology firm has a non-compete clause requiring its employees to not work for competitors for five years after they quit, but it was boilerplate written by the lawyers, and it never gets enforced.  

A young employee quits the firm, and goes to work for one of its competitors.  It turns out, however, that this particular competitor is also a leader in the church that the boss of the first company used to be a member of, until he got kicked out for apostasy.  

The boss goes to court to enforce the noncompete, and the employee offers evidence that he's only enforcing the contract because of a religious disagreement.  May the court enforce it?

# Exercise: Racist Gated Community

The owners of a gated community on private land routinely carry out racial discrimination in allowing visitors, such as solicitors, even trick-or-treaters, into the community.  

The racist community generates protests, primarily but not exclusively by members of racial minority groups, unsurprisingly, and the protests trespass slightly onto the private land owned by the community.  

The police are summoned to get rid of the protestors.  May they?

# Exercise: Racist jeweler

The racist owner of a jewelry store routinely calls the police to chase out racial minorities on suspicion of attempted shoplifting.  

They're never guilty, but the police always show up, even though they know the owner is just a racist. 

Plaintiff, a member of a racial group whom the jewelry store owner profiles, goes to court enjoining the officers from enforcing the shopping center owner's evictions without actual evidence of shoplifting. Injunction granted?

# Exercise: Racist political party

The Texas Democratic Party, a privately incorporated organization, adopts a rule providing that only whites may participate in its primary elections. 

The laws of Texas provide that the Democratic Republican parties are entitled to place the winners of their primary elections on the general election as a matter of right. Those laws also regulate the membership and rulemaking processes of the Democratic and Republican parties. 

A plaintiff with standing challenges the Democratic Party rule under the Equal Protection Clause. Constitutional?


## Note on this exercise

Note that “private associations” sometimes, but not always, have a constitutional right to discriminate even to the point that anti-discrimination statutes cannot constitutionally apply to them, under the 1st amendment association right.  We haven’t covered this in the course, but it depends on the extent to which the association is super-intimate (“intimate association”), or about expressing a message contrary to the anti-discrimination law (“expressive association). See generally *Boy Scouts of America v. Dale*, 530 U.S. 640 (2000), which comprehensively goes over the doctrine.
