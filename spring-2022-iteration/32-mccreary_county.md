# McCreary County v. ACLU 

545 U.S. 844 (2005)

**JUSTICE SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.**

Executives of two counties posted a version of the Ten Commandments on the
walls of their courthouses. After suits were filed charging violations of the
Establishment Clause, the legislative body of each county adopted a resolution
calling for a more extensive exhibit meant to show that the Commandments are
Kentucky's "precedent legal code." The result in each instance was a modified display
of the Commandments surrounded by texts containing religious references as
their sole common element. After changing counsel, the counties revised the
exhibits again by eliminating some documents, expanding the text set out in
another, and adding some new ones.

The issues are whether a determination of the counties' purpose is a sound
basis for ruling on the Establishment Clause complaints, and whether
evaluation of the counties' claim of secular purpose for the ultimate displays
may take their evolution into account. We hold that the counties' manifest
objective may be dispositive of the constitutional enquiry, and that the
development of the presentation should be considered when determining its
purpose.

In the summer of 1999, petitioners McCreary County and Pulaski County,
Kentucky (hereinafter Counties), put up in their respective courthouses large,
gold-framed copies of an abridged text of the King James version of the Ten
Commandments, including a citation to the Book of Exodus. In McCreary
County, the placement of the Commandments responded to an order of the county
legislative body requiring "the display [to] be posted in `a very high traffic
area' of the courthouse." In Pulaski
County, amidst reported controversy over the propriety of the display, the
Commandments were hung in a ceremony presided over by the county Judge-
Executive, who called them "good rules to live by" and who recounted the story
of an astronaut who became convinced "there must be a divine God" after
viewing the Earth from the moon. The Judge-Executive was accompanied by the pastor of his church, who called the Commandments "a creed of ethics" and told the press after the
ceremony that displaying the Commandments was "one of the greatest things the
judge could have done to close out the millennium." In both Counties, this was the version of the Commandments posted:

> Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

> Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images.

> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.

> Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

> Honor thy father and thy mother.

> Thou shalt not kill.

> Thou shalt not commit adultery.

> Thou shalt not steal.

> Thou shalt not bear false witness.

> Thou shalt not covet.

> Exodus 20:3-17.

In each County, the hallway display was "readily visible to . . . county
citizens who use the courthouse to conduct their civic business, to obtain or
renew driver's licenses and permits, to register cars, to pay local taxes, and
to register to vote." 

In November 1999, respondents American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky et
al. sued the Counties in Federal District Court and sought a preliminary injunction against maintaining the displays, which the ACLU charged were violations of the prohibition of religious establishment included in the First Amendment of the
Constitution. Within a month, and before the District Court had
responded to the request for injunction, the legislative body of each County
authorized a second, expanded display, by nearly identical resolutions
reciting that the Ten Commandments are "the precedent legal code upon which
the civil and criminal codes of . . . Kentucky are founded," and stating
several grounds for taking that position: that "the Ten Commandments are
codified in Kentucky's civil and criminal laws"; that the Kentucky House of
Representatives had in 1993 "voted unanimously . . . to adjourn . . . `in
remembrance and honor of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics'"; that the
"County Judge and . . . magistrates agree with the arguments set out by Judge
[Roy] Moore" in defense of his "display [of] the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom"; and that the "Founding Father[s] [had an] explicit understanding
of the duty of elected officials to publicly acknowledge God as the source of
America's strength and direction." 

As directed by the resolutions, the Counties expanded the displays of the Ten
Commandments in their locations, presumably along with copies of the
resolution, which instructed that it, too, be posted. In addition
to the first display's large framed copy of the edited King James version of
the Commandments, the second included eight other documents in smaller
frames, each either having a religious theme or excerpted to highlight a
religious element. The documents were the "endowed by their Creator" passage
from the Declaration of Independence; the Preamble to the Constitution of
Kentucky; the national motto, "In God We Trust"; a page from the Congressional
Record of February 2, 1983, proclaiming the Year of the Bible and including a
statement of the Ten Commandments; a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln
designating April 30, 1863, a National Day of Prayer and Humiliation; an
excerpt from President Lincoln's "Reply to Loyal Colored People of Baltimore
upon Presentation of a Bible," reading that "[t]he Bible is the best gift God
has ever given to man"; a proclamation by President Reagan marking 1983 the
Year of the Bible; and the Mayflower Compact. 

After argument, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction on May 5,
2000, ordering that the "display ... be removed from [each] County Courthouse
IMMEDIATELY" and that no county official "erect or cause to be erected similar
displays." The court's analysis of the situation followed the three-part formulation first stated in Lemon v. Kurtzman. As to governmental purpose, it
concluded that the original display "lack[ed] any secular purpose" because the
Commandments "are a distinctly religious document, believed by many Christians
and Jews to be the direct and revealed word of God."  Although the Counties had maintained that the original display was meant to be educational, "[t]he narrow scope of the display---a
single religious text unaccompanied by any interpretation explaining its role
as a foundational document---can hardly be said to present meaningfully the
story of this country's religious traditions." The court found that the second version also "clearly lack[ed] a secular purpose" because the "Count[ies] narrowly tailored [their]
selection of foundational documents to incorporate only those with
specific references to Christianity."

The Counties filed a notice of appeal from the preliminary injunction but
voluntarily dismissed it after hiring new lawyers. They then installed another
display in each court-house, the third within a year. No new resolution
authorized this one, nor did the Counties repeal the resolutions that preceded
the second. The posting consists of nine framed documents of equal size, one
of them setting out the Ten Commandments explicitly identified as the "King
James Version" at Exodus 20:3-17, and quoted at greater length than before.

Assembled with the Commandments are framed copies of the Magna Carta, the
Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, the lyrics of the Star
Spangled Banner, the May-flower Compact, the National Motto, the Preamble to
the Kentucky Constitution, and a picture of Lady Justice. The collection is
entitled "The Foundations of American Law and Government Display" and each
document comes with a statement about its historical and legal significance.
The comment on the Ten Commandments reads:

> "The Ten Commandments have profoundly influenced the formation of Western
> legal thought and the formation of our country. That influence is clearly
> seen in the Declaration of Independence, which declared that `We hold these
> truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
> endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these
> are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' The Ten Commandments
> provide the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the
> foundation of our legal tradition." 

The ACLU moved to supplement the preliminary injunction to enjoin the
Counties' third display,[6] and the Counties responded with several
explanations for the new version, including desires "to demonstrate that
the Ten Commandments were part of the foundation of American Law and
Government" and "to educate the citizens of the county regarding some of the
documents that played a significant role in the foundation of our system of
law and government." The court, however, took the objective of proclaiming the
Commandments' foundational value as "a religious, rather than secular,
purpose" and found that the assertion that the Counties' broader
educational goals are secular "crumble[s] ... upon an examination of the
history of this litigation." In light of the Counties' decision to
post the Commandments by themselves in the first instance, and later to "accentuat[e]" the religious objective by surrounding
the Commandments with "specific references to Christianity," the District
Court understood the Counties' "clear" purpose as being to post the
Commandments, not to educate.

Ever since Lemon v. Kurtzman summarized the three familiar considerations
for evaluating Establishment Clause claims, looking to whether government
action has "a secular legislative purpose" has been a common, albeit seldom
dispositive, element of our cases. 

The touchstone for our analysis is the principle that the "First Amendment
mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between
religion and nonreligion."  When the government acts with the ostensible and predominant
purpose of advancing religion, it violates that central Establishment Clause
value of official religious neutrality, there being no neutrality when the
government's ostensible object is to take sides. Manifesting a
purpose to favor one faith over another, or adherence to religion generally,
clashes with the "understanding, reached . . . after decades of religious war,
that liberty and social stability demand a religious tolerance that respects
the religious views of all citizens ...."  By showing a purpose to favor
religion, the government "sends the . . . message to . . . nonadherents `that
they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an
accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members . .
. .'" 

Indeed, the purpose apparent from government action can have an impact more
significant than the result expressly decreed: when the government
maintains Sunday closing laws, it advances religion only minimally because
many working people would take the day as one of rest regardless, but if the
government justified its decision with a stated desire for all Americans to
honor Christ, the divisive thrust of the official action would be inescapable.
This is the teaching of McGowan v. Maryland, which
upheld Sunday closing statutes on practical, secular grounds after finding
that the government had forsaken the religious purposes behind centuries-old
predecessor laws. 

Despite the intuitive importance of official purpose to the realization of
Establishment Clause values, the Counties ask us to abandon Lemon's purpose
test, or at least to truncate any enquiry into purpose here. Their first
argument is that the very consideration of purpose is deceptive: according to
them, true "purpose" is unknowable, and its search merely an excuse for courts
to act selectively and unpredictably in picking out evidence of subjective
intent. The assertions are as seismic as they are unconvincing.

Examination of purpose is a staple of statutory interpretation that makes up
the daily fare of every appellate court in the country, e.g., General
Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline (interpreting statute in light of its "text, structure, purpose, and history"), and governmental purpose is a key element of a good deal of constitutional doctrine, e.g. Washington v. Davis. With enquiries into purpose this common, if they were nothing but hunts for mares' nests deflecting attention from bare judicial will, the whole notion of purpose in law would have dropped into disrepute long ago.

But scrutinizing purpose does make practical sense, as in Establishment Clause
analysis, where an understanding of official objective emerges from readily
discoverable fact, without any judicial psychoanalysis of a drafter's heart of
hearts. The eyes that look to purpose belong to an "`objective observer,'" one who
takes account of the traditional external signs that show up in the "`text,
legislative history, and implementation of the statute,'" or comparable
official act. 

After declining the invitation to abandon concern with purpose wholesale, we
also have to avoid the Counties' alternative tack of trivializing the enquiry
into it. The Counties would read the cases as if the purpose enquiry were so
naive that any transparent claim to secularity would satisfy it, and they
would cut context out of the enquiry, to the point of ignoring history, no
matter what bearing it actually had on the significance of current
circumstances. There is no precedent for the Counties' arguments, or reason
supporting them.

Lemon said that government action must have "a secular. . . purpose," and after a host of cases it is fair to add that although a
legislature's stated reasons will generally get deference, the secular purpose
required has to be genuine, not a sham, and not merely secondary to a
religious objective. [T]he Court often does accept
governmental statements of purpose, in keeping with the respect owed in the
first instance to such official claims. But in those unusual cases where the
claim was an apparent sham, or the secular purpose secondary, the unsurprising
results have been findings of no adequate secular object, as against a
predominantly religious one.

The Counties' second proffered limitation can be dispatched quickly. They
argue that purpose in a case like this one should be inferred, if at all, only
from the latest news about the last in a series of governmental actions,
however close they may all be in time and subject. But the world is not made
brand new every morning, and the Counties are simply asking us to ignore
perfectly probative evidence; they want an absentminded objective observer,
not one presumed to be familiar with the history of the government's actions
and competent to learn what history has to show. The Counties' position just bucks common sense: reasonable
observers have reasonable memories, and our precedents sensibly forbid an
observer "to turn a blind eye to the context in which [the] policy arose."

[Discussion of why the first display was obviously religious.]

Once the Counties were sued, they modified the exhibits and invited additional
insight into their purpose in a display that hung for about six months. This
new one was the product of forthright and nearly identical Pulaski and
McCreary County resolutions listing a series of American historical documents
with theistic and Christian references, which were to be posted in order
to furnish a setting for displaying the Ten Commandments and any "other
Kentucky and American historical documen[t]" without raising concern about
"any Christian or religious references" in them. As
mentioned, the resolutions expressed support for an Alabama judge who posted
the Commandments in his courtroom, and cited the fact the Kentucky Legislature
once adjourned a session in honor of "Jesus Christ, the Prince of Ethics."

In this second display, unlike the first, the Commandments were not hung in
isolation, merely leaving the Counties' purpose to emerge from the pervasively
religious text of the Commandments themselves. Instead, the second version was
required to include the statement of the government's purpose expressly set
out in the county resolutions, and underscored it by juxtaposing the
Commandments to other documents with highlighted references to God as their
sole common element. The display's unstinting focus was on religious passages,
showing that the Counties were posting the Commandments precisely because of
their sectarian content. That demonstration of the government's objective was
enhanced by serial religious references and the accompanying resolution's
claim about the embodiment of ethics in Christ. Together, the display and
resolution presented an indisputable, and undisputed, showing of an
impermissible purpose.

Today, the Counties make no attempt to defend their undeniable objective, but
instead hopefully describe version two as "dead and buried."  Their refusal to defend the second display is understandable,
but the reasonable observer could not forget it.

After the Counties changed lawyers, they mounted a third display, without a
new resolution or repeal of the old one. The result was the "Foundations of
American Law and Government" exhibit, which placed the Commandments in
the company of other documents the Counties thought especially significant in
the historical foundation of American government. In trying to persuade the
District Court to lift the preliminary injunction, the Counties cited several
new purposes for the third version, including a desire "to educate the
citizens of the county regarding some of the documents that played a
significant role in the foundation of our system of law and government."

These new statements of purpose were presented only as a litigating position,
there being no further authorizing action by the Counties' governing boards.
And although repeal of the earlier county authorizations would not have erased
them from the record of evidence bearing on current purpose, the
extraordinary resolutions for the second display passed just months earlier
were not repealed or otherwise repudiated. Indeed, the sectarian
spirit of the common resolution found enhanced expression in the third
display, which quoted more of the purely religious language of the
Commandments than the first two displays had done. No reasonable observer could swallow the claim that the Counties
had cast off the objective so unmistakable in the earlier displays.

Nor did the selection of posted material suggest a clear theme that might
prevail over evidence of the continuing religious object. In a collection of
documents said to be "foundational" to American government, it is at least odd
to include a patriotic anthem, but to omit the Fourteenth Amendment, the most
significant structural provision adopted since the original Framing. And it is
no less baffling to leave out the original Constitution of 1787 while quoting
the 1215 Magna Carta even to the point of its declaration that "fish-weirs
shall be removed from the Thames." If an observer found
these choices and omissions perplexing in isolation, he would be puzzled for a different reason when he read the Declaration of Independence seeking
confirmation for the Counties' posted explanation that the Ten
Commandments'"influence is clearly seen in the Declaration";
in fact the observer would find that the Commandments are sanctioned as divine
imperatives, while the Declaration of Independence holds that the authority of
government to enforce the law derives "from the consent of the governed." If the observer had not thrown up his hands, he would
probably suspect that the Counties were simply reaching for any way to keep a
religious document on the walls of courthouses constitutionally required to
embody religious neutrality.

In holding the preliminary injunction adequately supported by evidence that
the Counties' purpose had not changed at the third stage, we do not decide
that the Counties' past actions forever taint any effort on their part to
deal with the subject matter. We hold only that purpose needs to be taken
seriously under the Establishment Clause and needs to be understood in light
of context; an implausible claim that governmental purpose has changed should
not carry the day in a court of law any more than in a head with common sense.

Nor do we have occasion here to hold that a sacred text can never be
integrated constitutionally into a governmental display on the subject of law,
or American history. We do not forget, and in this litigation have frequently
been reminded, that our own courtroom frieze was deliberately designed in the
exercise of governmental authority so as to include the figure of Moses
holding tablets exhibiting a portion of the Hebrew text of the later,
secularly phrased Commandments; in the company of 17 other lawgivers, most of
them secular figures, there is no risk that Moses would strike an observer as
evidence that the National Government was violating neutrality in
religion.
