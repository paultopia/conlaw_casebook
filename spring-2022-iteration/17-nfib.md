      Today we resolve constitutional challenges to two provi-
    sions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
    2010: the individual mandate, which requires individuals
    to purchase a health insurance policy providing a mini-
    mum level of coverage; and the Medicaid expansion, which
    gives funds to the States on the condition that they pro-
    vide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls
    below a certain threshold. We do not consider whether the
    Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted
    to the Nation’s elected leaders. We ask only whether
    Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact
    the challenged provisions.
    

     This case concerns two powers that the Constitution
    does grant the Federal Government, but which must be
    read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority
    akin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes
    Congress to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and
    among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Our precedents read that to mean that
    Congress may regulate “the channels of interstate com-
    merce,” “persons or things in interstate commerce,” and
    “those activities that substantially affect interstate com-
    merce.” Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks
    omitted). The power over activities that substantially
    affect interstate commerce can be expansive. That power
    has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-
    ingly local matters as a farmer’s decision to grow wheat
    for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark’s extor-
    tionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.

       Congress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Im-
    posts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the
    common Defence and general Welfare of the United
    States.”  Put simply, Con-
    gress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal
    Government considerable influence even in areas where
    it cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may
    enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,
    or otherwise control. And in exercising its spending power,
    Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition
    those offers on compliance with specified conditions.  These
    offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that
    the Federal Government itself could not impose. 

       The reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated
    powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes
    Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and
    proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.” We have long read this provision to give
    Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: “Let the
    end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitu-
    tion, and all means which are appropriate, which are
    plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
    consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” McCulloch.
    
       Our permissive reading of these powers is explained in
    part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the
    Nation’s elected leaders. “Proper respect for a co-ordinate
    branch of the government” requires that we strike down
    an Act of Congress only if “the lack of constitutional
    authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demon-
    strated.” 

    
                                 I
       In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119. The Act aims to in-
    crease the number of Americans covered by health in-
    surance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act’s 10
    titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of
    provisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to
    two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual
    mandate and the Medicaid expansion.
    
       The individual mandate requires most Americans to
    maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage. Many individuals will receive the required coverage through their employer, or from a government pro-
    gram such as Medicaid or Medicare. But
    for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive
    health insurance through a third party, the means of
    satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a
    private company.
    
       Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the
    mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment”
    to the Federal Government. That payment,
    which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a
    percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on
    a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the aver-
    age annual premium the individual would have to pay for
    qualifying private health insurance.  In 2016,
    for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-
    ual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more
    than the average yearly premium for insurance that co-
    vers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,
    prescription drugs and hospitalization). The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes,
    and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner”as tax penalties, such as the penalty for claiming too large an income tax refund.  The
    Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its nor-
    mal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and
    levies. And some individuals who are sub-
    ject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the
    penalty—for example, those with income below a certain
    threshold and members of Indian tribes. 

       On the day the President signed the Act into law, Flor-
    ida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal
    District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Those
    plaintiffs—who are both respondents and petitioners here,
    depending on the issue—were subsequently joined by 13
    more States, several individuals, and the National Fed-
    eration of Independent Business. The plaintiffs alleged,
    among other things, that the individual mandate provi-
    sions of the Act exceeded Congress’s powers under Article
    I of the Constitution. 
        
       The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly
    challenged here is the Medicaid expansion. Enacted in
    1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist
    pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the
    elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care.  In order to receive that funding,
    States must comply with federal criteria governing mat-
    ters such as who receives care and what services are pro-
    vided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to
    participate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through
    the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of
    state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most
    States’ total revenue.
    
       The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medi-
    caid program and increases the number of individuals the
    States must cover. For example, the Act requires state
    programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with
    incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level,
    whereas many States now cover adults with children only
    if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover
    childless adults at all. The
    Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in
    expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a
    portion of the costs on their own. If a State
    does not comply with the Act’s new coverage require-
    ments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those
    requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. 

       Along with their challenge to the individual mandate,
    the state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the
    Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress’s constitutional powers. 

      We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the
    Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with respect to
    both the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion. Because no party supports the Elev-
    enth Circuit’s holding that the individual mandate can
    be completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable
    Care Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that
    aspect of the judgment below. And because there is a
    reasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act de-
    prives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-
    ual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we
    appointed an amicus curiae to advance it.
    
       Before turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have
    the authority to do so. The Anti-Injunction Act provides
    that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment
    or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court
    by any person, whether or not such person is the per-
    son against whom such tax was assessed.”This statute protects the Government’s ability
    to collect a consistent stream of revenue, by barring litiga-
    tion to enjoin or otherwise obstruct the collection of taxes.
    Because of the Anti-Injunction Act, taxes can ordinarily be challenged only after they are paid, by suing for a refund.

       The penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care
    Act’s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in
    2014. The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to
    restrain the penalty’s future collection. Amicus contends
    that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a
    tax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this
    suit.

       The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.
    The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits “for the purpose
    of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”
     Congress, however, chose to
    describe the “[s]hared responsibility payment” imposed on
    those who forgo health insurance not as a “tax,” but as a
    “penalty.”  There is no immediate
    reason to think that a statute applying to “any tax” would
    apply to a “penalty.”
    
       Congress’s decision to label this exaction a “penalty”
    rather than a “tax” is significant because the Affordable
    Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as
    “taxes.”  Where
    Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute
    and different language in another, it is generally pre-
    sumed that Congress acts intentionally. 
.
       Amicus argues that even though Congress did not label
    the shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it
    as such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions
    like a tax. It is true that Congress cannot change whether
    an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-
    poses simply by describing it as one or the other. Congress
    may not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing
    Clause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause’s constraint
    on criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial punishment a “tax.” See Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co. (1922).

       The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,
    however, are creatures of Congress’s own creation. How
    they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best
    evidence of Congress’s intent is the statutory text. We
    have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily
    described “taxes” even where that label was inaccurate.
    
       Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty
    but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for pur-
    poses of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example,§6671(a) provides that “any reference in this title to ‘tax’
    imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the
    penalties and liabilities provided by” subchapter 68B of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B
    are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes
    the Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, how-
    ever, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any
    other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26
    shall also be “deemed” to apply to the individual mandate.
    
       Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the
    Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,
    albeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-
    ifies that the penalty for not complying with the man-
    date “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner
    as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter
    68.” Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,
    “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as
    taxes.” §6671(a). According to amicus, by directing that
    the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same man-
    ner as taxes,” §5000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act
    applicable to this penalty.
           The Government disagrees. It argues that §5000A(g)(1)
    does not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act,
    because §5000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of
    the Treasury to use the same “ ‘methodology and proce-
    dures’ ” to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.

       We think the Government has the better reading. As
    it observes, “Assessment” and “Collection” are chapters of
    the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-
    ity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying
    the means by which he shall do so. Section
    5000A(g)(1)’s command that the penalty be “assessed and
    collected in the same manner” as taxes is best read as
    referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the
    same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.
    That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of
    §5000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he
    may use to collect the penalty. The
    Anti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the
    procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.
    
    
      The Affordable Care Act does not require that the pen-
    alty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be
    treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.
    The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this
    suit, and we may proceed to the merits.
    
                                  III
    
       The Government advances two theories for the proposi-
    tion that Congress had constitutional authority to enact
    the individual mandate. First, the Government argues
    that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under
    the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may
    order individuals to buy health insurance because the
    failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-
    dercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms. Second,
    the Government argues that if the commerce power does
    not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it
    as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax. According to the
    Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct
    individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the indi-
    vidual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,
    and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.
                                      III.A
                                      
      The Government’s first argument is that the individual
    mandate is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the
    Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.
    According to the Government, the health care market is
    characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Every-
    one will eventually need health care at a time and to an
    extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insur-
    ance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because
    state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to
    provide a certain degree of care to individuals without
    regard to their ability to pay, hospitals end up receiving
    compensation for only a portion of the services they pro-
    vide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to
    insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass
    on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher pre-
    miums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompen-
    sated care raises family health insurance premiums, on
    average, by over $1,000 per year. 

      In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the
    problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage
    because of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It
    did so through the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “community-
    rating” provisions. These provisions together prohibit in-
    surance companies from denying coverage to those with
    such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher
    premiums than healthy individuals. 

      The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do
    not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who
    choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health
    care needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that
    problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay
    purchasing health insurance until they become sick, rely-
    ing on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.

    The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on
    insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals
    but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay
    for their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly
    increase premiums on everyone. 

      The individual mandate was Congress’s solution to
    these problems. By requiring that individuals purchase
    health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by
    those who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the
    mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy
    individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher
    than their health care expenses. This allows insurers to
    subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals
    the reforms require them to accept. The Government
    claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and
    Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.
    
                                   
       The Government contends that the individual mandate
    is within Congress’s power because the failure to pur-
    chase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect
    on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting problem. The path of our Commerce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, but
    it is now well established that Congress has broad authority under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,
    that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is
    not confined to the regulation of commerce among the
    states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial
    effect on interstate commerce.”  Congress’s power, moreover, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself
    substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends
    to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar
    activities of others. See Wickard.
    
       Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Congress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety
    of ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But
    Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to
    compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase
    an unwanted product. Legislative novelty is not necessarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But
    sometimes “the most telling indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent”
    for Congress’s action.  At the
    very least, we should “pause to consider the implications of
    the Government’s arguments” when confronted with such
    new conceptions of federal power. 

       The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate
    Commerce.” The power
    to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated. If the power to “regulate”
    something included the power to create it, many of the
    provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous. For
    example, the Constitution gives Congress the power to
    “coin Money,” in addition to the power to “regulate the
    Value thereof.” And it gives Congress the power to “raise and support Armies” and to “provide and main-
    tain a Navy,” in addition to the power to “make Rules
    for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
    Forces.” If the power to regulate the
    armed forces or the value of money included the power to
    bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the
    specific grant of such powers would have been unneces-
    sary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natu-
    ral understanding that the power to regulate assumes
    there is already something to be regulated. 

       The individual mandate, however, does not regulate
    existing commercial activity. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product,
    on the ground that their failure to do so affects interstate
    commerce. Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are
    doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Every day individuals do
    not do an infinite number of things. In some cases they decide not to do something; in others they simply fail to
    do it. Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by
    pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring
    countless decisions an individual could potentially make
    within the scope of federal regulation, and—under the
    Government’s theory—empower Congress to make those
    decisions for him.
    
       Applying the Government’s logic to the familiar case of
    Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry
    us from the notion of a government of limited powers. In
    Wickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-
    posed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption
    on his own farm. That
    amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota
    under a program designed to support the price of wheat by
    limiting supply. The Court rejected the farmer’s argument
    that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the
    reach of the commerce power. It did so on the ground that
    the farmer’s decision to grow wheat for his own use al-
    lowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market. That
    decision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-
    ilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-
    fect on the interstate market for wheat. 

       Wickard has long been regarded as “perhaps the most
    far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over
    intrastate activity,” but the Gov-
    ernment’s theory in this case would go much further.
    Under Wickard it is within Congress’s power to regulate
    the market for wheat by supporting its price. But price
    can be supported by increasing demand as well as by
    decreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some
    consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect
    on the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase
    health insurance have on the price of insurance. Congress
    can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so,
    just as it argues here that it may command that those not buying health insurance do so. The farmer in Wickard
    was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat,
    and the Government could regulate that activity because
    of its effect on commerce. The Government’s theory here
    would effectively override that limitation, by establishing
    that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce
    Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something
    the Government would have them do.
    
       Indeed, the Government’s logic would justify a manda-
    tory purchase to solve almost any problem.  To
    consider a different example in the health care market, many
    Americans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes
    up a larger percentage of the total population than those
    without health insurance. The failure of that group
    to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a
    greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to purchase insurance. See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &
    Dietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity:
    Payer- and Service-Specific Estimates. Those increased costs are borne in part by other Americans who
    must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the
    insured.  Congress addressed the insurance problem by
    ordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Gov-
    ernment’s theory, Congress could address the diet problem
    by ordering everyone to buy vegetables. 

       People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things
    that would be good for them or good for society. Those
    failures—joined with the similar failures of others—can
    readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
    Under the Government’s logic, that authorizes Congress to
    use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the
    Government would have them act.

       That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution
    envisioned. James Madison explained that the Commerce
    Clause was “an addition which few oppose and from which
    no apprehensions are entertained.” The Federalist No. 45. While Congress’s authority under the Commerce
    Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the
    national economy, our cases have “always recognized that
    the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has
    limits.” The
    Government’s theory would erode those limits, permitting
    Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its author-
    ity, “everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and
    drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” The Feder-
    alist No. 48. Congress already enjoys
    vast power to regulate much of what we do. Accepting
    the Government’s theory would give Congress the same
    license to regulate what we do not do, fundamentally
    changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal Government.
    
       To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between
    activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic
    effects on commerce. But the distinction between doing
    something and doing nothing would not have been lost on
    the Framers, who were “practical statesmen,” not meta-
    physical philosophers.  As we have ex-
    plained, “the framers of the Constitution were not mere
    visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but
    practical men, dealing with the facts of political life as
    they understood them, putting into form the government
    they were creating, and prescribing in language clear
    and intelligible the powers that government was to take.”

    The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate com-
    merce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our
    decisions and Congress’s actions have reflected this un-
    derstanding. There is no reason to depart from that un-
    derstanding now.
       The Government sees things differently. It argues that
    because sickness and injury are unpredictable but unavoidable, “the uninsured as a class are active in the market for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.” The individual mandate “merely regulates how individuals finance and pay for that
    active participation—requiring that they do so through
    insurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance
    with the back-stop of shifting costs to others.”^[In an attempt to recast the individual mandate as a regulation of commercial activity, JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that "[a]n individual who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance." But "self-insurance" is, in this context, nothing more than a description of the failure to purchase insurance. Individuals are no more "activ[e] in the self-insurance market" when they fail to purchase insurance, ibid., than they are active in the "rest" market when doing nothing.]

       The Government repeats the phrase “active in the market for health care” throughout its brief, but that concept has no constitutional significance.
    An individual who bought a car two years ago and may
    buy another in the future is not “active in the car market”
    in any pertinent sense. The phrase “active in the market”
    cannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by
    the individual mandate are not currently engaged in any
    commercial activity involving health care, and that fact is
    fatal to the Government’s effort to “regulate the uninsured
    as a class.”  Our precedents recognize Con-
    gress’s power to regulate “class[es] of activities,”  not
    classes of individuals, apart from any activity in which
    they are engaged.
    
       The individual mandate’s regulation of the uninsured as
    a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to
    existing commercial activity. The mandate primarily
    affects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to
    need significant health care and have other priorities for
    spending their money. It is precisely because these individuals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health
    care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of
    forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose
    greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect. If the individual mandate is targeted at a
    class, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than
    activity is its defining feature.
    
    
       The Government, however, claims that this does not
    matter. The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger
    Congress’s authority that almost all those who are unin-
    sured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage
    in a health care transaction. Asserting that “[t]here is no
    temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,” the Gov-
    ernment argues that because “[e]veryone subject to this
    regulation is in or will be in the health care market,” they
    can be “regulated in advance.” 

       The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct
    of an individual today because of prophesied future ac-
    tivity finds no support in our precedent. We have said that
    Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-
    nomic activity. But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that
    activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently
    engaged in commerce. Each one of our cases, including
    those cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, involved
    preexisting economic activity. 

       Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food,
    clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not
    authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular
    products in those or other markets today. The Commerce
    Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual
    from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably
    engage in particular transactions. Any police power to
    regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities,
    remains vested in the States.
    
       The Government argues that the individual mandate
    can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because
    health insurance is a unique product. According to the
    Government, upholding the individual mandate would
    not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or
    broccoli because, as the Government puts it, “[h]ealth insurance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or
    broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consumption and covering universal risks.” But cars and broccoli are no more purchased
    for their “own sake” than health insurance. They are
    purchased to cover the need for transportation and food.
    
       The Government says that health insurance and health
    care financing are “inherently integrated.” But that does not mean the compelled purchase
    of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the
    second. No matter how “inherently integrated” health
    insurance and health care consumption may be, they are
    not the same thing: They involve different transactions,
    entered into at different times, with different providers.
    And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant
    health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.
    The proximity and degree of connection between the
    mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lacking to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Government. The individual mandate forces individuals
    into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain
    from commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sustained under a clause authorizing Congress to “regulate
    Commerce.”

      The Government next contends that Congress has the
    power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the
    individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral
    part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”---the guaranteed-issue and community-rating insurance
    reforms. Under this argument, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an
    individual’s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it
    is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a
    way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.
    
       The power to “make all Laws which shall be necessary
    and proper for carrying into Execution” the powers enu-
    merated in the Constitution vests Congress with authority to enact provisions “incidental to the
    [enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial exer-
    cise,” McCulloch. Although the Clause
    gives Congress authority to “legislate on that vast mass
    of incidental powers which must be involved in the con-
    stitution,” it does not license the exercise of any “great
    substantive and independent power[s]” beyond those specifi-
    cally enumerated. Instead, the Clause is
    “merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty,
    that the means of carrying into execution those [powers]
    otherwise granted are included in the grant.”

       As our jurisprudence under the Necessary and Proper
    Clause has developed, we have been very deferential to
    Congress’s determination that a regulation is “necessary.”
    We have thus upheld laws that are “ ‘convenient, or use-
    ful’ or ‘conducive’ to the authority’s ‘beneficial exercise.’ ” But we have also carried out our
    responsibility to declare unconstitutional those laws that
    undermine the structure of government established by the
    Constitution. Such laws, which are not “consist[ent] with
    the letter and spirit of the constitution,” McCulloch, are not “proper [means] for carrying into Execution” Congress’s enumerated powers. Rather, they are, “in the words of The Federalist, ‘merely acts of usurpation’
    which ‘deserve to be treated as such.’ ” Printz.

       Applying these principles, the individual mandate cannot be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause
    as an essential component of the insurance reforms. Each
    of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service
    to, a granted power. For example, we have upheld provisions permitting continued confinement of those already
    in federal custody when they could not be safely released; criminaliz-
    ing bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds; and
    tolling state statutes of limitations while cases are pending in federal court. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to
    create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enumerated power.
       
       This is in no way an authority that is “narrow in scope,” or “incidental” to
    the exercise of the commerce power. Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and
    Proper Clause would work a substantial expansion of
    federal authority. No longer would Congress be limited to
    regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some
    preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of
    federal regulation. Instead, Congress could reach beyond the natural limit of its authority and draw within its
    regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of
    it. Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the
    Act’s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal
    power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms
    effective.
    
       The Government relies primarily on our decision in
    Gonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered “comprehen-
    sive legislation to regulate the interstate market” in mari-
    juana. Certain individuals sought an
    exemption from that regulation on the ground that they
    engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.
    We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana
    is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could
    be readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress’s
    attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana
    would therefore have been substantially undercut if it
    could not also regulate intrastate possession and consumption. Accordingly, we recognized that
    “Congress was acting well within its authority” under the
    Necessary and Proper Clause even though its “regulation
    ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.”  Raich thus did not involve
    the exercise of any “great substantive and independent
    power” of the sort at issue here.
    Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of “indi-
    vidual applications of a concededly valid statutory
    scheme.” 
    
       Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as
    a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to
    purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as
    a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance re-
    forms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the
    mandate. Accord, post, at 4–16 (joint opinion of SCALIA,
    KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).

       That is not the end of the matter. Because the Com-
    merce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it
    is necessary to turn to the Government’s second argument:
    that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s
    enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.” 

       The Government’s tax power argument asks us to view
    the statute differently than we did in considering its commerce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause
    argument, the Government defended the mandate as a
    regulation requiring individuals to purchase health insurance. The Government does not claim that the taxing
    power allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,
    the Government asks us to read the mandate not as order-
    ing individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a
    tax on those who do not buy that product.
       
       The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one
    possible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that
    reads “no vehicles in the park” might, or might not, ban
    bicycles in the park. And it is well established that if
    a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates
    the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that
    does not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: “No
    court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it unavoidable, to give a construction to it which should involve
    a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.” Justice
    Holmes made the same point a century later: “[T]he rule is
    settled that as between two possible interpretations of a
    statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and
    by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which
    will save the Act.” 

       The most straightforward reading of the mandate is
    that it commands individuals to purchase insurance. After all, it states that individuals “shall” maintain health
    insurance.  Congress thought it
    could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,
    and the Government primarily defended the law on that
    basis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Com-
    merce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under
    our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the
    Government’s alternative reading of the statute—that it
    only imposes a tax on those without insurance—is a rea-
    sonable one.
    
       Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain
    health insurance, the only consequence is that he must
    make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his
    taxes. That, according to the Government,
    means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a
    condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a
    tax—the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,
    the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.
    Rather, it makes going without insurance just another
    thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earn-
    ing income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike
    on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it
    may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.
       
       The question is not whether that is the most natural
    interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a
    “fairly possible” one.  As we have explained, “every reasonable construc-
    tion must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from
    unconstitutionality.”  The Government asks us to interpret the
    mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate
    the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of
    deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for
    the reasons set forth below.
  
                                    III.C
                                    
       The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those
    without health insurance looks like a tax in many respects. The “[s]hared responsibility payment,” as the
    statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by “taxpayer[s]” when they file their tax returns. It does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their household income
    is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue
    Code. For taxpayers who do owe the payment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as
    taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing
    status. The requirement to
    pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by
    the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess
    and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.”  This process yields the essential feature of any tax:
    it produces at least some revenue for the Government. Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion
    per year by 2017. Congressional Budget Office, Payments
    of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
       
       It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as
    a “penalty,” not a “tax.” But while that label is fatal to the
    application of the Anti-Injunction Act, it
    does not determine whether the payment may be viewed
    as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any
    particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress’s choice of label on that question. That choice does
    not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.
       
       Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two
    challenges to the “Child Labor Tax” on the same day. In
    the first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-
    called tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. Congress knew that suits to obstruct
    taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction
    Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress
    therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In
    the second case, however, we held that the same exaction,
    although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-
    gress’s taxing power. That constitutional question was not controlled by Congress’s choice of label.
    
       We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes
    nonetheless were authorized by Congress’s power to tax.
    In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal
    licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets—for which the
    licensee had to pay a fee—could be sustained as exercises
    of the taxing power. And in New York v.
    United States we upheld as a tax a “surcharge” on out-of-
    state nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was
    paid to the Federal Treasury. We thus
    ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls
    within Congress’s taxing power, “[d]isregarding the designa-
    tion of the exaction, and viewing its substance and appli-
    cation.” 


        The same analysis here suggests that the shared re-
    sponsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be
    considered a tax, not a penalty: First, for most Americans
    the amount due will be far less than the price of insur-
    ance, and, by statute, it can never be more. It may often be a reasonable financial decision to make the payment
    rather than purchase insurance, unlike the “prohibitory”
    financial punishment in Drexel Furniture.  Second, the individual mandate contains no scienter
    requirement. Third, the payment is collected solely by the
    IRS through the normal means of taxation—except that
    the Service is not allowed to use those means most sugges-
    tive of a punitive sanction, such as criminal prosecution. The reasons the Court in Drexel Furni-
    ture held that what was called a “tax” there was a penalty
    support the conclusion that what is called a “penalty” here
    may be viewed as a tax.
    
       None of this is to say that the payment is not intended
    to affect individual conduct. Although the payment will
    raise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to ex-
    pand health insurance coverage. But taxes that seek to
    influence conduct are nothing new. Some of our earliest
    federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported
    manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of do-
    mestic industry.  Today, federal and state taxes
    can compose more than half the retail price of cigarettes, not just to raise more money, but to encourage people to
    quit smoking. And we have upheld such obviously regula-
    tory measures as taxes on selling marijuana and sawed-off
    shotguns. Indeed, “[e]very tax is in some measure regula-
    tory. To some extent it interposes an economic impediment
    to the activity taxed as compared with others not taxed.” That §5000A seeks to shape
    decisions about whether to buy health insurance does not
    mean that it cannot be a valid exercise of the taxing
    power.
    
       In distinguishing penalties from taxes, this Court has
    explained that “if the concept of penalty means anything,
    it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.” While the individual
    mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health
    insurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do
    so is unlawful. Neither the Act nor any other law attaches
    negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. The Government agrees with that reading, confirming that if
    someone chooses to pay rather than obtain health insur-
    ance, they have fully complied with the law. 

       Indeed, it is estimated that four million people each year
    will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance.  We would
    expect Congress to be troubled by that prospect if such
    conduct were unlawful. That Congress apparently regards
    such extensive failure to comply with the mandate as tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was
    creating four million outlaws. It suggests instead that the
    shared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citizens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health
    insurance.
    
       The plaintiffs contend that Congress’s choice of lan-
    guage—stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance
    or pay a “penalty”—requires reading §5000A as punishing
    unlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-
    der the law unconstitutional. We have rejected a similar
    argument before. In New York v. United States we exam-
    ined a statute providing that “[e]ach State shall be re-
    sponsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low-level
    radioactive waste.” A State that shipped its waste to another
    State was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State,
    a portion of which would be paid over to the Federal
    Government. And a State that did not adhere to the
    statutory scheme faced “[p]enalties for failure to comply,”
    including increases in the surcharge. New
    York, 505 U. S., at 152–153. New York urged us to read
    the statute as a federal command that the state legisla-
    ture enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would
    have violated the Constitution. To avoid that outcome, we
    interpreted the statute to impose only “a series of incen-
    tives” for the State to take responsibility for its waste. We
    then sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government
    as an exercise of the taxing power. We
    see no insurmountable obstacle to a similar approach
    here.
    
        
       The joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold
    §5000A as a tax because Congress did not “frame” it as
    such. In effect, they contend that even if
    the Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we
    interpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down
    because Congress used the wrong labels. An example may
    help illustrate why labels should not control here. Sup-
    pose Congress enacted a statute providing that every
    taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient win-
    dows must pay $50 to the IRS. The amount due is adjusted
    based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing
    status, and is paid along with the taxpayer’s income tax
    return. Those whose income is below the filing threshold
    need not pay. The required payment is not called a “tax,”
    a “penalty,” or anything else. No one would doubt that
    this law imposed a tax, and was within Congress’s power
    to tax. That conclusion should not change simply because
    Congress used the word “penalty” to describe the pay-
    ment. Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly
    “[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.”
    Rather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature’s
    enactment.
    
       Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the
    power to impose the exaction in §5000A under the taxing
    power, and that §5000A need not be read to do more than
    impose a tax. That is sufficient to sustain it. The “ques-
    tion of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress
    does not depend on recitals of the power which it under-
    takes to exercise.” 

       Even if the taxing power enables Congress to impose
    a tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must
    still comply with other requirements in the Constitution.
    Plaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment
    does not do so, citing Article I, §9, clause 4. That clause
    provides: “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,
    unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein
    before directed to be taken.” This requirement means that
    any “direct Tax” must be apportioned so that each State
    pays in proportion to its population. According to the
    plaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a
    direct tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress
    made no effort to apportion it among the States.
 
       Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was
    unclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as
    a “head tax” or a “poll tax”), might be a direct tax. 
    Soon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on ownership of carriages, over James Madison’s objection that it
    was an unapportioned direct tax. This Court
    upheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such
    a tax would make little sense, because it would have required taxing carriage owners at dramatically different
    rates depending on how many carriages were in their
    home State. The Court was unanimous,
    and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly
    asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of
    taxation were direct: capitations and land taxes. 
       That narrow view of what a direct tax might be persisted for a century.  In
    1895, we expanded our interpretation to include taxes on
    personal property and income from personal property, in
    the course of striking down aspects of the federal income
    tax. That result was overturned by the Sixteenth
    Amendment, although we continued to consider taxes on
    personal property to be direct taxes. 

      A tax on going without health insurance does not fall
    within any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a
    capitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person,
    “without regard to property, profession, or any other cir-
    cumstance.” The whole point of the shared respon-
    sibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-
    cumstances---earning a certain amount of income but not
    obtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly
    not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.
    The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax
    that must be apportioned among the several States.
    
      There may, however, be a more fundamental objection
    to a tax on those who lack health insurance. Even if only
    a tax, the payment under §5000A(b) remains a burden
    that the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not
    an act. If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause
    as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain
    from commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to
    permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.
    
      Three considerations allay this concern. First, and most
    importantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does
    not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through
    inactivity. A capitation, after all, is a tax that everyone must pay simply for existing, and capitations are
    expressly contemplated by the Constitution. The Court
    today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we abstain from the regulated activity. But from its creation,
    the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to
    taxes. See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy
    (Nov. 13, 1789) (“Our new Constitution is now established
    . . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain,
    except death and taxes”).
    
        Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Com-
    merce Clause is a question about the scope of federal
    authority. Its answer depends on whether Congress can
    exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of
    directing individuals to purchase insurance. Congress’s
    use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something
    is, by contrast, not new. Tax incentives already promote,
    for example, purchasing homes and professional educa-
    tions. Sustaining the
    mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has
    properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchas-
    ing health insurance, not whether it can. Upholding the
    individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does
    not recognize any new federal power. It determines that
    Congress has used an existing one.
    
        Second, Congress’s ability to use its taxing power to
    influence conduct is not without limits. A few of our cases
    policed these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive
    exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior otherwise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority. More often and more recently
    we have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive
    or effect of revenue-raising measures.  We have nonetheless
    maintained that “there comes a time in the extension of
    the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses
    its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the
    characteristics of regulation and punishment.” 

       We have already explained that the shared responsibility payment’s practical characteristics pass muster as a
    tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing
    power. Because the tax at hand is
    within even those strict limits, we need not here decide the
    precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive
    that the taxing power does not authorize it. It remains
    true, however, that the “power to tax is not the power to
    destroy while this Court sits.” 
    
       Third, although the breadth of Congress’s power to tax
    is greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing
    power does not give Congress the same degree of control
    over individual behavior. Once we recognize that Congress may regulate a particular decision under the Com-
    merce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full
    weight to bear. Congress may simply command individuals to do as it directs. An individual who disobeys may
    be subjected to criminal sanctions. Those sanctions can
    include not only fines and imprisonment, but all the attendant consequences of being branded a criminal: deprivation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right
    to bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment opportunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other
    controversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.
    
       By contrast, Congress’s authority under the taxing
    power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money
    into the Federal Treasury, no more. If a tax is properly
    paid, the Government has no power to compel or punish
    individuals subject to it. We do not make light of the severe burden that taxation---especially taxation motivated
    by a regulatory purpose---can impose. But imposition of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful
    choice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing
    to pay a tax levied on that choice.^[Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax due, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although not for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 26 U.S.C. §5000A(g)(2)). But that does not show that the tax restricts the lawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax is predicated. Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.]
    
      The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain in-
    dividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health
    insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Be-
    cause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role
    to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.
    
                    
                                 IV 
    
                                  A
    
      The States also contend that the Medicaid expansion
    exceeds Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause.
    They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt
    the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a
    State’s Medicaid grants, unless the State accepts the new
    expanded funding and complies with the conditions that
    come with it. This, they argue, violates the basic principle
    that the “Federal Government may not compel the States
    to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.” 

      There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases
    state obligations under Medicaid. The current Medicaid
    program requires States to cover only certain discrete
    categories of needy individuals—pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. There is no mandatory
    coverage for most childless adults, and the States typically
    do not offer any such coverage. The States also enjoy
    considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels
    for parents of needy families. On
    average States cover only those unemployed parents who
    make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and
    only those employed parents who make less than 63 per-
    cent of the poverty line. 

      The Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in
    contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid programs by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65
    with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line. The Act also establishes a new “[e]ssential health benefits” package, which States must
    provide to all new Medicaid recipients—a level sufficient
    to satisfy a recipient’s obligations under the individual mandate.  The Affordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government
    will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly
    eligible individuals through In the
    following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent. In light of
    the expansion in coverage mandated by the Act, the Federal
    Government estimates that its Medicaid spending will increase by approximately $100 billion per year, nearly 40 percent above current levels. 

       The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay
    the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the
    United States.”  We have
    long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant
    federal funds to the States, and may condition such a
    grant upon the States’ “taking certain actions that Congress could not require them to take.”  Such measures “encourage a State
    to regulate in a particular way, [and] influenc[e] a State’s
    policy choices.” New York, supra, at 166. The conditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are
    used by the States to “provide for the . . . general Welfare”
    in the manner Congress intended.
    
       At the same time, our cases have recognized limits on
    Congress’s power under the Spending Clause to secure
    state compliance with federal objectives. “We have repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as
    ‘much in the nature of a contract.'” The legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power “thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly
    accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ”  Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring
    that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the
    status of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-
    eral system. That system “rests on what might at first
    seem a counterintuitive insight, that ‘freedom is enhanced
    by the creation of two governments, not one.’” For this reason, “the Constitution
    has never been understood to confer upon Congress the
    ability to require the States to govern according to Con-
    gress’ instructions.” Otherwise
    the two-government system established by the Framers
    would give way to a system that vests power in one central
    government, and individual liberty would suffer.
    
       That insight has led this Court to strike down federal legislation that commandeers a State’s legislative or
    administrative apparatus for federal purposes.  It has also led us to scrutinize Spending
    Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using
    financial inducements to exert a “power akin to undue
    influence.” Congress may use its spending power to cre-
    ate incentives for States to act in accordance with federal
    policies. But when “pressure turns into compulsion”
    the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.
    “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the
    authority to require the States to regulate.”  That is true whether Congress directly
    commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State
    to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.
    
       Permitting the Federal Government to force the States
    to implement a federal program would threaten the politi-
    cal accountability key to our federal system. “[W]here the
    Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may
    be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-
    latory program may remain insulated from the electoral
    ramifications of their decision.” Spending
    Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has
    a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation,
    state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for
    choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when
    the State has no choice, the Federal Government can
    achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in
    New York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened
    when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because
    Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it
    could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.
    
       We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine. That
    case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated
    if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that
    met certain federally specified conditions. An employer
    sued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly “driv[ing]
    the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure
    into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws
    at the bidding of the central government.”  We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Gov-
    ernment might employ its taxing power to exert a “power
    akin to undue influence” upon the States.  But
    we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and
    abatement program to channel money to the States that
    would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for use in providing national unemployment services. Congress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the
    money into state programs only on the condition that the
    money be used for the same purposes. Predicating tax
    abatement on a State’s adoption of a particular type of un-
    employment legislation was therefore a means to “safeguard [the Federal Government’s] own treasury.”  We held that “[i]n such circumstances, if in no others, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the
    bounds of power.”
    
       In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a
    “weapon of coercion, destroying or impairing the auton-
    omy of the states,” the Court noted that there was no
    reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other
    than through “her unfettered will.” Indeed, the State itself did “not offer a suggestion that in
    passing the unemployment law she was affected by du-
    ress.” 
    
       As our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress
    may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and
    spending programs to preserve its control over the use of
    federal funds. In the typical case we look to the States to
    defend their prerogatives by adopting “the simple expedient of not yielding” to federal blandishments when they
    do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own. The
    States are separate and independent sovereigns. Sometimes they have to act like it.
    
       The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion
    is far from the typical case. They object that Congress has
    “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from
    coercion” in the way it has struc-
    tured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the
    new funds to States that will not accept the new conditions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those
    States’ existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling
    States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care
    coverage effected by the Act.
    
       Given the nature of the threat and the programs at
    issue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress’s
    authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States’
    complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,
    because that is the means by which Congress ensures that
    the funds are spent according to its view of the “general
    Welfare.” Conditions that do not here govern the use
    of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba-
    sis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of
    threats to terminate other significant independent grants,
    the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressur-
    ing the States to accept policy changes.
    
       In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a
    federal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a
    State’s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its
    drinking age to 21. The Court found that the condition
    was “directly related to one of the main purposes for which
    highway funds are expended—safe interstate travel.”  At the same time, the condition was not a
    restriction on how the highway funds---set aside for specific highway improvement and maintenance efforts---were to be used.
    
       We accordingly asked whether “the financial induce-
    ment offered by Congress” was “so coercive as to pass the
    point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’ ”  By “financial inducement” the Court meant the threat of losing five
    percent of highway funds; no new money was offered to
    the States to raise their drinking ages. We found that the
    inducement was not impermissibly coercive, because
    Congress was offering only “relatively mild encouragement
    to the States.”  We observed that
    “all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%” of
    her highway funds. In fact, the federal funds at
    stake constituted less than half of one percent of South
    Dakota’s budget at the time.  In
    consequence, “we conclude[d] that [the] encouragement
    to state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.” Whether to accept the drinking
    age change “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not
    merely in theory but in fact.” 
    
       In this case, the financial “inducement” Congress has
    chosen is much more than “relatively mild encouragement”---it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medi-
    caid Act provides that if a State’s Medicaid plan does
    not comply with the Act’s requirements, the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services may declare that “further
    payments will not be made to the State.” A State that opts out of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion in health care coverage thus stands to lose not
    merely “a relatively small percentage” of its existing Medicaid funding, but all of it. Medicaid spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average
    State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83
    percent of those costs. The Federal Gov-
    ernment estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3
    trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs
    of pre-expansion Medicaid. In addition, the States have developed intricate
    statutory and administrative regimes over the course of
    many decades to implement their objectives under existing
    Medicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could conclude that the threatened loss of less than half of one
    percent of South Dakota’s budget left that State with a “prerogative” to reject Congress’s desired policy, “not
    merely in theory but in fact.” The
    threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall
    budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the
    States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid
    expansion.
    
      JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that Dole is distinguishable
    because here “Congress has not threatened to withhold
    funds earmarked for any other program.”  But
    that begs the question: The States contend that the expansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is
    forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the
    existing Medicaid program. We cannot agree that existing
    Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable
    Care Act are all one program simply because “Congress
    styled” them as such. If the expansion is not
    properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid
    program, Congress’s decision to so title it is irrelevant.

       Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expansion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the existing program because the States agreed that Congress
    could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on
    in the first place. The Government observes that the
    Social Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid
    provisions, contains a clause expressly reserving “[t]he
    right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision” of that
    statute.So it does. But “if Congress
    intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.” A State confronted with statutory language reserving the right to “alter” or “amend” the pertinent provisions
    of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that
    Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medicaid program as it developed. Congress has in fact done
    so, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other
    times both old and new. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-
    ments of 1972 (extending Medicaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new
    funding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, (extending eligibility, and
    conditioning old and new funds).
    
       The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift
    in kind, not merely degree. The original program was de-
    signed to cover medical services for four particular cat-
    egories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly,
    and needy families with dependent children.  Previous amendments to Medicaid
    eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of
    these categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid
    is transformed into a program to meet the health care
    needs of the entire nonelderly population with income
    below 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a
    program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an
    element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage.^[JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that the States can have no objection to the Medicaid expansion, because "Congress could have repealed Medicaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA." But it would certainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit, if not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing program and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political reconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be "ritualistic." The same is true of JUSTICE GINSBURG’s suggestion that Congress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.]

       Indeed, the manner in which the expansion is struc-
    tured indicates that while Congress may have styled the
    expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recognized it was enlisting the States in a new health care
    program. Congress created a separate funding provision
    to cover the costs of providing services to any person
    made newly eligible by the expansion. While Congress pays
    50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid, once the expansion is
    fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the
    costs for newly eligible persons. The conditions on use of the different funds are also distinct. Congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level
    of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional
    Medicaid benefit package. 

       As we have explained, “[t]hough Congress’ power to
    legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not
    include surprising participating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid program included the power to transform it so dramatically.
    
       JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that in fact this expansion is
    no different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such
    that “a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked
    fair notice.” But the prior change she dis-
    cusses—presumably the most dramatic alteration she could
    find—does not come close to working the transformation
    the expansion accomplishes. She highlights an amend-
    ment requiring States to cover pregnant women and in-
    creasing the number of eligible children. But this
    modification can hardly be described as a major change in
    a program that—from its inception—provided health care
    for “families with dependent children.” Previous Medicaid
    amendments simply do not fall into the same category as
    the one at stake here.
    
       The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to “fix
    the outermost line” where persuasion gives way to coercion. The Court found it “[e]nough for
    present purposes that wherever the line may be, this
    statute is within it.”  We have no need to fix a line
    either. It is enough for today that wherever that line may
    be, this statute is surely beyond it. Congress may not
    simply “conscript state [agencies] into the national bu-
    reaucratic army,” and that is what it is attempting to do
    with the Medicaid expansion.
    
                                  IV.B
                                  
      Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering
    funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that States accepting
    such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What
    Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose
    not to participate in that new program by taking away
    their existing Medicaid funding. Section 1396c gives the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to do just that. It allows her to withhold all “further [Medicaid] payments . . . to the State” if she determines that the
    State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement,
    including those contained in the expansion.  In light of the Court’s holding, the Secretary
    cannot apply §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds
    for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the
    expansion.
       That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have
    identified. The chapter of the United States Code that
    contains §1396c includes a severability clause confirming
    that we need go no further. That clause specifies that “[i]f
    any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to
    any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder
    of the chapter, and the application of such provision to
    other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”
    §1303. Today’s holding does not affect the continued ap-
    plication of §1396c to the existing Medicaid program. Nor
    does it affect the Secretary’s ability to withdraw funds pro-
    vided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has
    chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with
    the requirements of that Act.
    
   The question remains whether today’s holding affects
    other provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In considering that question, “[w]e seek to determine what Congress
    would have intended in light of the Court’s constitutional
    holding.”  Our “touch-
    stone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent,
    for a court cannot use its remedial powers to circumvent the intent of the legislature.”  The question
    here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of
    the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a
    genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid
    expansion. Unless it is “evident” that the answer is no, we
    must leave the rest of the Act intact. 

      We are confident that Congress would have wanted to
    preserve the rest of the Act. It is fair to say that Congress
    assumed that every State would participate in the Medicaid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to
    do so. The States contend that Congress enacted the rest
    of the Act with such full participation in mind; they point
    out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying
    the mandate, and enacted
    no other plan for providing coverage to many low-income
    individuals. According to the States, this means that the
    entire Act must fall.
    
      We disagree. The Court today limits the financial pres-
    sure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept
    the terms of the Medicaid expansion. As a practical mat-
    ter, that means States may now choose to reject the expansion; that is the whole point. But that does not mean
    all or even any will. Some States may indeed decline to
    participate, either because they are unsure they will be
    able to afford their share of the new funding obligations,
    or because they are unwilling to commit the administrative resources necessary to support the expansion. Other
    States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea
    of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly
    given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the
    outset.
    
       We have no way of knowing how many States will ac-
    cept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe
    Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply
    because some may choose not to participate. The other
    reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain “fully
    operative as a law” and will still
    function in a way “consistent with Congress’ basic objec-
    tives in enacting the statute.” 
    Confident that Congress would not have intended anything different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need
    not fall in light of our constitutional holding.
    

      The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and
    unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot
    be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the
    Commerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to
    regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to
    engage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those
    who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go
    without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress’s power to tax.
    
      As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening
    existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to
    order the States to regulate according to its instructions.
    Congress may offer the States grants and require the
    States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the
    States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the
    offer. The States are given no such choice in this case:
    They must either accept a basic change in the nature of
    Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding. The remedy
    for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal
    Government from imposing such a sanction. That remedy
    does not require striking down other portions of the Affordable Care Act.

       I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the Anti-Injunction

    Unlike THE CHIEF JUSTICE, however, I would hold, alterna­tively, that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to

    exactly as Congress enacted it.

                                 A

       In enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
    Act (ACA), Congress comprehensively reformed the
    national market for health-care products and services.
    By any measure, that market is immense. Collectively,
    Americans spent $2.5 trillion on health care in 2009,
    accounting for 17.6% of our Nation’s economy.  Within the next decade,
    it is anticipated, spending on health care will nearly dou­ble.
    
       The health-care market’s size is not its only distinctive
    feature. Unlike the market for almost any other product
    or service, the market for medical care is one in which all
    individuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person
    residing in the United States, sooner or later, will visit
    a doctor or other health-care professional. See Dept. of
    Health and Human Services, National Center for Health
    Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults:
    National Health Interview Survey 2009 (Over 99.5% of adults above
    65 have visited a health-care professional.). Most people
    will do so repeatedly. See (In 2009
    alone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor’s
    office.).
    
       When individuals make those visits, they face another
    reality of the current market for medical care: its high
    cost. In 2010, on average, an individual in the United
    States incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses. Over a life­
    time, costs mount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. When a person requires nonroutine care, the
    cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.
    A single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs up­
    wards of $10,000. Treatments for
    many serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly
    cost a substantial sum. Brief for Economic Scholars as
    Amici Curiae (citing a study indicat­
    ing that, in 1998, the cost of treating a heart attack for the
    first 90 days exceeded $20,000, while the annual cost of
    treating certain cancers was more than $50,000).
    
       Although every U. S. domiciliary will incur significant
    medical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when
    care will be needed is often unpredictable. An accident, a
    heart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs with­
    out warning. Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing
    medical care without a moment’s notice. 

       To manage the risks associated with medical care—
    its high cost, its unpredictability, and its inevitability---most people in the United States obtain health insurance.
    Many (approximately 170 million in 2009) are insured by
    private insurance companies. Others, including those
    over 65 and certain poor and disabled persons, rely on
    government-funded insurance programs, notably Medicare
    and Medicaid. Combined, private health insurers and
    State and Federal Governments finance almost 85% of the medical care administered to U. S. residents. 

       Not all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.
    In 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured,
    either by choice or, more likely, because they could not
    afford private insurance and did not qualify for govern­
    ment aid. As a group, uninsured individ­
    uals annually consume more than $100 billion in healthcare services, nearly 5% of the Nation’s total.  Over 60% of those without insurance
    visit a doctor’s office or emergency room in a given year.

                                  B

      The large number of individuals without health insur­
    ance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national
    health-care market.  As just
    noted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a seri­
    ous illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford
    to pay on her own. Unlike markets for most products,
    however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that
    an uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and
    state law, as well as professional obligations and embed­
    ded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to
    provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the
    patient’s ability to pay. 

       As a consequence, medical-care providers deliver sig-
    nificant amounts of care to the uninsured for which the
    providers receive no payment. In 2008, for example, hospi-
    tals, physicians, and other health-care professionals
    received no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116
    billion in care they administered to those without insur­
    ance. 

       Health-care providers do not absorb these bad debts.
    Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost
    of uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the
    government and private insurance companies. In response,
    private insurers increase their premiums, shifting the
    cost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who
    carry insurance. The net result: Those with health insur­
    ance subsidize the medical care of those without it. As
    economists would describe what happens, the uninsured
    “free ride” on those who pay for health insurance.

       The size of this subsidy is considerable. Congress found
    that the cost-shifting just described “increases family
    [insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.” Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance
    less affordable, forcing more people to go without insur­ance and leading to further cost-shifting.
    
       And it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among
    the uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health
    care and health insurance. Insurance companies and
    health-care providers know that some percentage of
    healthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury
    each year and will receive medical care despite their ina­
    bility to pay. In anticipation of this uncompensated care,
    health-care companies raise their prices, and insurers
    their premiums. In other words, because any uninsured
    person may need medical care at any moment and because
    health-care companies must account for that risk, every
    uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care
    and medical insurance.
    
       The failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other
    deleterious effects on the health-care market. Because
    those without insurance generally lack access to preventa­
    tive care, they do not receive treatment for conditionslike hypertension and diabetes---that can be successfully
    and affordably treated if diagnosed early on. When
    sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care, once
    treatable conditions have escalated into grave health
    problems, requiring more costly and extensive interven­tion.  The extra time and resources provid­ers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers’
    ability to care for those who do have insurance. 


                               C

      States cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on
    their own. Like Social Security benefits, a universal
    health-care system, if adopted by an individual State,
    would be “bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere,
    encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose.” An influx of unhealthy individuals
    into a State with universal health care would result in
    increased spending on medical services. To cover the
    increased costs, a State would have to raise taxes, and
    private health-insurance companies would have to in­
    crease premiums. Higher taxes and increased insurance
    costs would, in turn, encourage businesses and healthy
    individuals to leave the State.
    

                                 D

      Aware that a national solution was required, Congress
    could have taken over the health-insurance market by
    establishing a tax-and-spend federal program like Social
    Security. Such a program, commonly referred to as a
    single-payer system (where the sole payer is the Federal
    Government), would have left little, if any, room for pri­vate enterprise or the States. Instead of going this route,
    Congress enacted the ACA, a solution that retains a ro­bust role for private insurers and state governments. To
    make its chosen approach work, however, Congress had to use some new tools, including a requirement that most
    individuals obtain private health insurance coverage. As explained below, by employing
    these tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto­gether reasonable, solution.
    
      A central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of
    uninsured U. S. residents.  The minimum coverage
    provision advances this objective by giving potential recip­
    ients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insur­
    ance. Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual
    must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a
    tax penalty. 

      The minimum coverage provision serves a further pur­
    pose vital to Congress’ plan to reduce the number of unin­
    sured. Congress knew that encouraging individuals to
    purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem,
    because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by
    choice. Of particular concern to Congress were people
    who, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot
    acquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical
    conditions.
    
      Before the ACA’s enactment, private insurance compa­
    nies took an applicant’s medical history into account when
    setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an
    individual. Because individuals with preexisting medical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more
    than those without such conditions, insurers routinely re-
    fused to insure these individuals, charged them substan­
    tially higher premiums, or offered only limited coverage
    that did not include the preexisting illness. See Dept. of
    Health and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the
    Current Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind
    1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non­
    elderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged
    higher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).
    
       To ensure that individuals with medical histories have
    access to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three­
    part solution. First, Congress imposed a “guaranteed is­
    sue” requirement, which bars insurers from denying
    coverage to any person on account of that person’s medical
    condition or history. Second, Congress required
    insurers to use “community rating” to price their insurance
    policies. Community rating, in effect, bars
    insurance companies from charging higher premiums
    to those with preexisting conditions.
    
       But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could
    not work effectively unless individuals were given a pow­
    erful incentive to obtain insurance. 
    
       In the 1990’s, several States—including New York, New
    Jersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire,
    and Vermont—enacted guaranteed-issue and community­
    rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of
    insurance coverage. The results were disastrous. “All seven states suffered from skyrocketing insurance pre­mium costs, reductions in individuals with coverage, and
    reductions in insurance products and providers.” 

       Congress comprehended that guaranteed-issue and
    community-rating laws alone will not work. When insur­ance companies are required to insure the sick at afforda­ble prices, individuals can wait until they become ill to buy
    insurance. Pretty soon, those in need of immediate medi­cal care---i.e., those who cost insurers the most---become
    the insurance companies’ main customers. This “adverse
    selection” problem leaves insurers with two choices: They
    can either raise premiums dramatically to cover their
    ever-increasing costs or they can exit the market. In the
    seven States that tried guaranteed-issue and community­
    rating requirements without a minimum coverage provi­sion, that is precisely what insurance companies did. 

       Massachusetts, Congress was told, cracked the adverse
    selection problem. By requiring most residents to obtain
    insurance, the Commonwealth ensured that insurers would not be
    left with only the sick as customers. As a result, federal
    lawmakers observed, Massachusetts succeeded where
    other States had failed.  In cou­
    pling the minimum coverage provision with guaranteed­
    issue and community-rating prescriptions, Congress
    followed Massachusetts’ lead.
    

       In sum, Congress passed the minimum coverage provi­
    sion as a key component of the ACA to address an econom­
    ic and social problem that has plagued the Nation for
    decades: the large number of U. S. residents who are
    unable or unwilling to obtain health insurance. Whatever
    one thinks of the policy decision Congress made, it was
    Congress’ prerogative to make it. Reviewed with appro­priate deference, the minimum coverage provision, allied
    to the guaranteed-issue and community---rating prescrip­
    tions, should survive measurement under the Commerce
    and Necessary and Proper Clauses.
    
                              II

                              A

      The Commerce Clause, it is widely acknowledged, “was
    the Framers’ response to the central problem that gave
    rise to the Constitution itself.”  Under the Articles of Confederation, the
    Constitution’s precursor, the regulation of commerce was
    left to the States. This scheme proved unworkable, be­
    cause the individual States, understandably focused on
    their own economic interests, often failed to take actions
    critical to the success of the Nation as a whole. 

       What was needed was a “national Government . . .
    armed with a positive & compleat authority in all cases
    where uniform measures are necessary.” The Framers’ solution was the Commerce
    Clause, which, as they perceived it, granted Congress the
    authority to enact economic legislation “in all Cases for
    the general Interests of the Union, and also in those Cases
    to which the States are separately incompetent.” 

      The Framers understood that the “general Interests of
    the Union” would change over time, in ways they could not
    anticipate. Accordingly, they recognized that the Consti­
    tution was of necessity a “great outlin[e],” not a detailed
    blueprint, and that its provisions included broad concepts, to
    be “explained by the context or by the facts of the case.”

                               B

      Consistent with the Framers’ intent, we have repeatedly
    emphasized that Congress’ authority under the Commerce
    Clause is dependent upon “practical” considerations,
    including “actual experience.”  We afford Congress the
    leeway “to undertake to solve national problems directly
    and realistically.” 

       Until today, this Court’s pragmatic approach to judging
    whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power
    was guided by two familiar principles. First, Congress has
    the power to regulate economic activities “that substan­
    tially affect interstate commerce.” This capacious power extends even to
    local activities that, viewed in the aggregate, have a sub­
    stantial impact on interstate commerce. 
       Second, we owe a large measure of respect to Congress
    when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation. When appraising such legislation, we
    ask only (1) whether Congress had a “rational basis” for
    concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects
    interstate commerce, and (2) whether there is a “reasona­ble connection between the regulatory means selected and the asserted ends.” 

 In answering these
    questions, we presume the statute under review is consti­
    tutional and may strike it down only on a “plain showing”
    that Congress acted irrationally. 

                                   C

      Straightforward application of these principles would
    require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage
    provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond
    dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that
    the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate
    commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of
    dollars of health-care products and services each year.  Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered
    largely by national and regional companies who routinely
    transact business across state lines. The uninsured also
    cross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emer­
    gencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a
    neighboring State that provides better care for those who
    have not prepaid for care. 

      Not only do those without insurance consume a large
    amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier
    explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of
    that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on
    other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta­
    bility.  Given these far-reaching effects
    on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is
    hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing”; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.

       The minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a
    “reasonable connection” to Congress’ goal of protecting the
    health-care market from the disruption caused by individ­uals who fail to obtain insurance. By requiring those who
    do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum cover­
    age provision gives individuals a strong incentive to in­
    sure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe,
    would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspond­
    ingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on
    the national health-care market.
    
       Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured
    individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain
    insurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier ob­served, because every person is at risk of needing care at
    any moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of
    their current health status, adversely affect the price of
    health care and health insurance.  Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to
    those in need of immediate care simply could not work.
    Insurance companies would either charge these individu­als prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community­ rating regulations were in place, close up shop. 

       “[W]here we find that the legislators . . . have a rational
    basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.” Congress’ enactment
    of the minimum coverage provision, which addresses a
    specific interstate problem in a practical, experience­
    informed manner, easily meets this criterion.
    

      Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the
    minimum coverage provision in the manner established by
    our precedents, THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies on a newly
    minted constitutional doctrine. The commerce power does
    not, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress
    to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce
    by purchasing a product.” 

          1.a
                                           
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s novel constraint on Congress’
    commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for
    that reason alone warrants disapprobation. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel
    individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an
    unwanted product,” such a limitation would be
    inapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume
    health-care products and services. Thus,
    if THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance­
    purchase requirement can be applied only to those who
    “actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage
    provision fits the bill.
    
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi­
    dents participate in the market for health services over
    the course of their lives.  But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,
    the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market for health care, because “[t]he proximity and degree of
    connection between the [uninsured today] and [their]
    subsequent commercial activity is too lacking.” 

       This argument has multiple flaws. First, more than
    60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor’s
    office each year.  Nearly 90% will within
    five years. An uninsured’s consumption of health care is
    thus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the
    next five years and more likely than not to occur this year.
    
       Equally evident, Congress has no way of separating
    those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medical care today (surely their consumption of medical care
    is sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need
    medical services for years to come. No one knows when an
    emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the unin­
    sured arise daily. To capture individuals who unexpectedly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then,
    Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to
    a doctor anytime soon. Congress, our decisions instruct,
    has authority to cast its net that wide. See Perez v. United
    States,  (“[W]hen it is necessary
    in order to prevent an evil to make the law embrace more
    than the precise thing to be prevented it may do so.”^[Echoing THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the joint dissenters urge that the min­imum coverage provision impermissibly regulates young people who “have no intention of purchasing [medical care]” and are too far “re­moved from the [health-care] market.” This criticism ignores the reality that a healthy young person may be a day away from needing health care. A victim of an accident or unforeseen illness will consume extensive medical care immediately, though scarcely expecting to do so.]

       Second, it is Congress’ role, not the Court’s, to delineate
    the boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to
    regulate. THE CHIEF JUSTICE defines the health-care mar-
    ket as including only those transactions that will occur
    either in the next instant or within some (unspecified)
    proximity to the next instant. But Congress could reason­
    ably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective,
    encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur
    over the next decade, not just those oc­curring here and now.
    
       Third, contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s contention, our
    precedent does indeed support “[t]he proposition that
    Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today
    because of prophesied future activity.” In
    Wickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Govern­ment imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he
    was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment
    Act of 1938 (AAA). He could not
    be penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the
    wheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open
    market. The Court rejected this argument. Wheat intended for home consumption,
    the Court noted, “overhangs the market, and if induced by
    rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price
    increases [intended by the AAA].” 

       Similar reasoning supported the Court’s judgment in
    Raich, which upheld Congress’ authority to regulate mari­
    juana grown for personal use.  Home­
    grown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar-
    ket for marijuana, we observed, for “the high demand in
    the interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana
    into that market.” 
    
       Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress’ authority,
    under the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an
    individual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from
    growing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to cease cultivating marijuana) because of a prophesied
    future transaction (the eventual sale of that wheat or
    marijuana in the interstate market). Congress’ actions
    are even more rational in this case, where the future
    activity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to
    occur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will
    take place.
    
       Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the
    health-care market, THE CHIEF JUSTICE draws an analogy
    to the car market. An individual “is not ‘active in the car
    market,’ ” THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, simply because he
    or she may someday buy a car. The analogy
    is inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medi­
    cal care and the guarantee that emergency care will be
    provided when required are conditions nonexistent in
    other markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of
    the market for broccoli as well. Although an individual
    might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no
    certainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants
    a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to
    pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nour­
    ishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense
    of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.  Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the
    ground that all are participants or will be participants in
    the health-care market would therefore carry no implica­
    tion that Congress may justify under the Commerce
    Clause a mandate to buy other products and services.
    
       Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage
    provision “compel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un­wanted product.” If unwanted today, medical service secured by
    insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow. Virtually
    everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point
    in his or her life. Health insurance is a
    means of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring
    individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not
    mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.
    Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which
    individuals pay for an interstate good they consume:
    Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical
    care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and
    through insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing
    payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate com­merce is quintessential economic regulation well within
    Congress’ domain. 

THE CHIEF JUSTICE also calls the minimum coverage
    provision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy
    individuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less
    hale and hardy. This complaint,
    too, is spurious. Under the current health-care system,
    healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for
    which they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need
    it, emergency medical care will be available, although they
    cannot afford it. Those who have in­
    surance bear the cost of this guarantee. By
    requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or
    pay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage
    provision ends the free ride these individuals currently
    enjoy.
    
       In the fullness of time, moreover, today’s young and healthy will become society’s old and infirm. Viewed over
    a lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who
    pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than
    their fair share when they become senior citizens. And
    even if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals,
    over their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance
    than they receive in health services, they have little to
    complain about, for that is how insurance works. Every
    insured person receives protection against a catastrophic
    loss, even though only a subset of the covered class will
    ultimately need that protection.
    
                                   b

       In any event, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s limitation of the
    commerce power to the regulation of those actively en­
    gaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Consti­
    tution or our decisions. Article I, §8, of the Constitution
    grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce . . .
    among the several States.” Nothing in this language im-
    plies that Congress’ commerce power is limited to regu-
    lating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.
    Indeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the
    Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among
    other things, “to require action.” 

       Arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that
    “the Constitution gives Congress the power to ‘coin
    Money,’ in addition to the power to ‘regulate the Value
    thereof,’ ” and similarly “gives Congress the power to ‘raise
    and support Armies’ and to ‘provide and maintain a Navy,’ in
    addition to the power to ‘make Rules for the Government
    and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.’”  In separating the
    power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of
    the regulation into existence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts,
    “[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is
    already something to be regulated.” 
    
       This argument is difficult to fathom. Requiring individ­uals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter­state health-insurance and health-care markets, both of
    them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA. Thus, the “some­
    thing to be regulated” was surely there when Congress
    created the minimum coverage provision.
    


       It is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Con­
    gress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg­
    ulate “activity” from those that regulate “inactivity.” As
    Judge Easterbrook noted, “it is possible to restate most
    actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.” Take this case as an example. An individual who
    opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can
    be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance:
    self-insurance. The minimum coverage
    provision could therefore be described as regulating activ­
    ists in the self-insurance market. Wickard is another
    example. Did the statute there at issue target activity
    (the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer’s
    failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)? If any­thing, the Court’s analysis suggested the latter. 



                                         2

       Underlying THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view that the Com­
    merce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active
    participants in a commercial market is a fear that the
    commerce power would otherwise know no limits. This concern is unfounded.
    
       First, THE CHIEF JUSTICE could certainly uphold the
    individual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche
    to enact any and all purchase mandates. As several times
    noted, the unique attributes of the health-care market
    render everyone active in that market and give rise to a
    significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other
    markets. 

 Nor would the commerce power be unbridled, absent
    THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s “activity” limitation. Congress would
    remain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has
    only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is
    traditionally left to state law. See Lopez; Morrison.
    
       An individual’s decision to self-insure, I have explained,
    is an economic act with the requisite connection to inter­
    state commerce. Other choices individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar
    description. As an example of the type of regulation he
    fears, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites a Government mandate to
    purchase green vegetables. One could call
    this concern “the broccoli horrible.” Congress, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning
    that an individual’s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the
    failure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on
    others. 
    
       Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have
    to accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate
    was likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care
    costs borne by lithe Americans. The Court would have to
    believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would
    then eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away),
    would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed
    or raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods,
    and would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise
    or little sleep) to trump the improved diet. Such “pil[ing
    of] inference upon inference” is just what the Court re­
    fused to do in Lopez and Morrison.^[The failure to purchase vegetables in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s hypothet­ical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others; rather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and the resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem. Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus several steps removed from solving the problem. The failure to obtain health insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting Congress sought to address through the ACA. Requiring individuals to obtain insurance attacks the source of the problem directly, in a single step.]
    
       Other provisions of the Constitution also check congres­
    sional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particular product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, inter­fered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a
    liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.

    
       Supplementing these legal restraints is a formidable
    check on congressional power: the democratic process.  As the controversy
    surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act at­
    tests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political
    resistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of
    state legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned
    authority to impose mandates, state governments have
    rarely done so. 

When contemplated in its extreme, almost any power
    looks dangerous. The commerce power, hypothetically,
    would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home
    production of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively
    compelling Americans to eat only vegetables. Yet no one
    would offer the “hypothetical and unreal possibilit[y]” of a vegetar­
    ian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the author­
    ity ever to ban the possession and sale of goods. THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE accepts just such specious logic when he
    cites the broccoli horrible as a reason to deny Congress
    the power to pass the individual mandate. 

    
                                   

                                III
    
                                 A
    
      For the reasons explained above, the minimum coverage
    provision is valid Commerce Clause legislation. See su-
    pra, Part II. When viewed as a component of the entire
    ACA, the provision’s constitutionality becomes even plain­
    er.
      The Necessary and Proper Clause “empowers Congress to enact laws in effectuation of its [commerce] powe[r]
    that are not within its authority to enact in isolation.” Hence, “[a] complex regulatory program . . . can survive a
    Commerce Clause challenge without a showing that every
    single facet of the program is independently and directly
    related to a valid congressional goal.” “It is enough that the challenged provisions
    are an integral part of the regulatory program and that
    the regulatory scheme when considered as a whole satis­
    fies this test.” 

Recall that one of Congress’ goals in enacting the Af­fordable Care Act was to eliminate the insurance indus­try’s practice of charging higher prices or denying coverage
    to individuals with preexisting medical conditions. The commerce power allows Congress to ban this practice, a point no one disputes. 
    
       Congress knew, however, that simply barring insurance
    companies from relying on an applicant’s medical history
    would not work in practice. Without the individual man­
    date, Congress learned, guaranteed-issue and community­ rating requirements would trigger an adverse-selection
    death-spiral in the health-insurance market: Insurance
    premiums would skyrocket, the number of uninsured
    would increase, and insurance companies would exit the
    market. When complemented by an
    insurance mandate, on the other hand, guaranteed issue
    and community rating would work as intended, increasing
    access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care. The minimum coverage provision is
    thus an “essential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic
    activity”; without the provision, “the regulatory scheme
    [w]ould be undercut.”  Put differently, the mini­
    mum coverage provision, together with the guaranteed­
    issue and community-rating requirements, is “ ‘reasonably
    adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end under
    the commerce power”: the elimination of pricing and
    sales practices that take an applicant’s medical history
    into account. 

                                B

      Asserting that the Necessary and Proper Clause does
    not authorize the minimum coverage provision, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE focuses on the word “proper.” A mandate to
    purchase health insurance is not “proper” legislation, THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE urges, because the command “under­
    mine[s] the structure of government established by the
    Constitution.” If long on rhetoric, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE’s argument is short on substance.
    
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites only two cases in which this
    Court concluded that a federal statute impermissibly
    transgressed the Constitution’s boundary between state
    and federal authority: Printz v. United States, and New York v. United States. The statutes at issue in both cases, however, compelled state officials to act on the
    Federal Government’s behalf.

       The minimum coverage provision, in contrast, acts
    “directly upon individuals, without employing the States
    as intermediaries.”  The provision is thus entirely consistent with the Consti­
    tution’s design. 

       Lacking case law support for his holding, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE nevertheless declares the minimum coverage
    provision not “proper” because it is less “narrow in scope”
    than other laws this Court has upheld under the Neces­
    sary and Proper Clause. THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s reliance on cases in
    which this Court has affirmed Congress’ “broad authority
    to enact federal legislation” under the Necessary and
    Proper Clause is underwhelming.
    
       Nor does THE CHIEF JUSTICE pause to explain why the
    power to direct either the purchase of health insurance or,
    alternatively, the payment of a penalty collectible as a tax
    is more far-reaching than other implied powers this Court
    has found meet under the Necessary and Proper Clause.
    These powers include the power to enact criminal laws, the
    power to imprison, including civil imprisonment; and the power
    to create a national bank.See also Jinks (affirming Congress’
    power to alter the way a state law is applied in state court,
    where the alteration “promotes fair and efficient operation
    of the federal courts”).^[Indeed, Congress regularly and uncontroversially requires individ­uals who are "doing nothing," to take action. Exam­ples include federal requirements to report for jury duty; to register for selective service; to purchase firearms and gear in anticipation of service in the Militia (Uniform Militia Act of 1792); to turn gold currency over to the Federal Government in exchange for paper currency, see Nortz v. United States (1935); and to file a tax return.]
    

       In failing to explain why the individual mandate threat­
    ens our constitutional order, THE CHIEF JUSTICE disserves
    future courts. How is a judge to decide, when ruling on
    the constitutionality of a federal statute, whether Con­
    gress employed an “independent power,” or
    merely a “derivative” one. Whether the power
    used is “substantive,” or just “incidental?" The instruction THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in effect, provides lower courts: You will know it when you see it.
    
    It is more than exaggeration to suggest that the mini­mum coverage provision improperly intrudes on “essential attributes of state sovereignty.”  First, the Affordable Care Act does not operate “in [an] are[a] such as criminal law enforcement or
    education where States historically have been sovereign.” As evidenced by Medicare, Medi­caid, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
    1974 (ERISA), and the Health Insurance Portability and
    Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the Federal Govern­ment plays a lead role in the health-care sector, both as a
    direct payer and as a regulator.
    
      Second, and perhaps most important, the minimum
    coverage provision, along with other provisions of the
    ACA, addresses the very sort of interstate problem that
    made the commerce power essential in our federal system.
    The crisis created by the large num­ber of U. S. residents who lack health insurance is one of
    national dimension that States are “separately incompe­
    tent” to handle.  Far from tram­pling on States’ sovereignty, the ACA attempts a federal solution for the very reason that the States, acting sepa­rately, cannot meet the need. Notably, the ACA serves the
    general welfare of the people of the United States while
    retaining a prominent role for the States. 

    
                                  V
       Through Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an
    opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid
    of federal financing. To receive federal Medicaid funds,
    States must provide health benefits to specified categories
    of needy persons, including pregnant women, children,
    parents, and adults with disabilities. Guaranteed eligibil­
    ity varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal
    poverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it
    depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state
    or federal assistance programs. The ACA enlarges the
    population of needy people States must cover to include
    adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed-
    eral poverty level. The spending power conferred by the
    Constitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Con­
    gress to define the contours of programs financed with
    federal funds. And to expand
    coverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legis­
    lation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as
    embracive of the poor as Congress chose.
    
       The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion,
    then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger popula­tion, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may
    it achieve the same result by amending existing law? The
    answer should be that Congress may expand by amend­
    ment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid
    benefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal
    and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the
    population served by a federally funded program would
    advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely
    serve the interests of federalism. To the contrary, such a
    requirement would rigidify Congress’ efforts to empower
    States by partnering with them in the implementation of
    federal programs.
    
       Medicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state coop­eration in serving the Nation’s general welfare. Rather
    than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uniform national health-care system for the poor, Congress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid
    grants to their particular needs, so long as they remain
    within bounds set by federal law. In shaping Medicaid,
    Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms
    participating states must meet; instead, Congress re­served the “right to alter, amend, or repeal” any provision
    of the Medicaid Act. States, for their
    part, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent
    with changes from time to time made in the federal law. And from 1965 to the
    present, States have regularly conformed to Congress’
    alterations of the Medicaid Act.
    
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that Congress may
    “condition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States’
    complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,” but nevertheless concludes that the 2010
    expansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on
    three premises, each of them essential to his theory. First,
    the Medicaid expansion is, in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view, a
    new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid pro­
    gram existing before the ACA’s enactment. Congress, THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, has threatened States with the
    loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them
    to adopt a new one. Second, the expansion was unforesee­
    able by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.
    Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the
    States have no real choice but to participate in the Medi­caid expansion. THE CHIEF JUSTICE therefore---for the
    first time ever---finds an exercise of Congress’ spending
    power unconstitutionally coercive.
    
       Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two
    spending programs; it is a single program with a constant
    aim---to enable poor persons to receive basic health care when they need it. Given past expansions, plus express
    statutory warning that Congress may change the re­
    quirements participating States must meet, there can be
    no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.
    Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medi­caid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds
    on Congress’ terms. Future Congresses are not bound
    by their predecessors’ dispositions; they have authority to
    spend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Gov­ernment, therefore, is not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE charges,
    threatening States with the loss of “existing” funds from
    one spending program in order to induce them to opt into
    another program. Congress is simply requiring States to
    do what States have long been required to do to receive
    Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress
    prescribes for participation.
    
       A majority of the Court, however, buys the argument
    that prospective withholding of funds formerly available
    exceeds Congress’ spending power. Given that holding, I
    entirely agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE as to the appropri­ate remedy. It is to bar the withholding found impermis­
    sible---not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap
    the expansion altogether. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the
    withholding—not the granting----of federal funds incom­patible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of
    Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its
    willingness to participate.
    
                                  A
    
       Expansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid pro­
    gram. Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as
    passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs
    jointly administered with the States. States were not
    required to participate in Medicaid. But if they did, the
    Federal Government paid at least half the costs. To qualify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of
    health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,
    state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with
    Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;
    and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. 

    At their option, States could enroll additional “medically
    needy” individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by
    the Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.

       Since 1965, Congress has amended the Medicaid pro­
    gram on more than 50 occasions, sometimes quite sizably.
    Most relevant here, between 1988 and 1990, Congress required participating States to include among their bene­ficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to 133%
    of the federal poverty level, children up to age 6 at the
    same income levels, and children ages 6 to 18 with family
    incomes up to 100% of the poverty level.  These amendments added millions to the
    Medicaid-eligible population. 

       Between 1966 and 1990, annual federal Medicaid spend­ing grew from $631.6 million to $42.6 billion; state
    spending rose to $31 billion over the same period.  And between 1990 and 2010,
    federal spending increased to $269.5 billion. En­largement of the population and services covered by Medi­
    caid, in short, has been the trend.
    
       Compared to past alterations, the ACA is notable for the
    extent to which the Federal Government will pick up the
    tab. Medicaid’s 2010 expansion is financed largely by
    federal outlays. In 2014, federal funds will cover 100%
    of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries; that rate will
    gradually decrease before settling at 90% in 2020. By comparison,
    federal contributions toward the care of beneficiaries
    eligible pre-ACA range from 50% to 83%, and averaged
    57% between 2005 and 2008. 

       Nor will the expansion exorbitantly increase state Medi­caid spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
    projects that States will spend 0.8% more than they would
    have, absent the ACA. Whatever the increase in state
    obligations after the ACA, it will pale in comparison to the
    increase in federal funding.
    
       Finally, any fair appraisal of Medicaid would require
    acknowledgment of the considerable autonomy States
    enjoy under the Act. Far from “conscript[ing] state agen­cies into the national bureaucratic army,” Medicaid “is designed to advance cooper­ative federalism.” Subject to its basic requirements, the Medicaid Act empowers States to “select
    dramatically different levels of funding and coverage,
    alter and experiment with different financing and delivery
    modes, and opt to cover (or not to cover) a range of particular procedures and therapies. States have leveraged
    this policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically
    different Medicaid programs over the past several dec­
    ades.”  States, as first-line ad­ministrators, will continue to guide the distribution of
    substantial resources among their needy populations.
    
       The alternative to conditional federal spending, it bears
    emphasis, is not state autonomy but state marginaliza­
    tion. In 1965, Congress elected to nationalize health
    coverage for seniors through Medicare. It could similarly
    have established Medicaid as an exclusively federal pro­gram. Instead, Congress gave the States the opportunity
    to partner in the program’s administration and develop­
    ment. Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is
    the state-level policy discretion and experimentation that
    is Medicaid’s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of fed­eralism are better served when States retain a meaningful role in the implementation of a program of such
    importance. 
                    B

       The Spending Clause authorizes Congress “to pay the
    Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the
    United States.” To ensure that federal funds
    granted to the States are spent “to ‘provide for the . . .
    general Welfare’ in the manner Congress intended,” Congress must of course have authority to impose
    limitations on the States’ use of the federal dollars. This
    Court, time and again, has respected Congress’ prescrip­tion of spending conditions, and has required States to
    abide by them.  In particular, we have recognized Congress’
    prerogative to condition a State’s receipt of Medicaid
    funding on compliance with the terms Congress set for
    participation in the program. 

       Congress’ authority to condition the use of federal funds
    is not confined to spending programs as first launched.
    The legislature may, and often does, amend the law, im­posing new conditions grant recipients henceforth must
    meet in order to continue receiving funds. 

       Yes, there are federalism-based limits on the use of
    Congress’ conditional spending power. In the leading
    decision in this area, South Dakota v. Dole, the Court identified four criteria. The conditions
    placed on federal grants to States must (a) promote the
    “general welfare,” (b) “unambiguously” inform States what
    is demanded of them, (c) be germane “to the federal inter­
    est in particular national projects or programs,” and (d)
    not “induce the States to engage in activities that would
    themselves be unconstitutional.” 

      The Court in Dole mentioned, but did not adopt, a fur­ther limitation, one hypothetically raised a half-century
    earlier: In “some circumstances,” Congress might be pro­hibited from offering a “financial inducement . . . so coer­cive as to pass the point at which ‘pressure turns into
    compulsion.’”  Prior to today’s deci­
    sion, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of
    any grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation
    and coercion.

       This case does not present the concerns that led the
    Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion. In
    Dole, the condition—set 21 as the minimum drinking age—
    did not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro-
    vided for highway construction. Further, in view of the
    Twenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether
    Congress could directly impose a national minimum
    drinking age.
    
       The ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally
    funded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply,
    Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked
    for any other program. Nor does the ACA use Medicaid
    funding to induce States to take action Congress itself
    could not undertake. The Federal Government undoubt­
    edly could operate its own health-care program for poor
    persons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors’ health care. 

That is what makes this such a simple case, and the
    Court’s decision so unsettling. Congress, aiming to assist
    the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize
    state health-insurance programs that meet federal stand­
    ards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the
    state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of
    the federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en­
    sures that federal funds will be spent on health care for
    the poor in furtherance of Congress’ present perception of
    the general welfare.
    
                                   C
    
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan­
    sion creates a “new health care program.” Moreover, States could “hardly anticipate” that Congress
    would “transform [the program] so dramatically.” Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress’
    threat to withhold “old” Medicaid funds based on a State’s
    refusal to participate in the “new” program is a “threa[t] to
    terminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].”  And because the threat to withhold a large amount
    of funds from one program “leaves the States with no real
    option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],” THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un­
    constitutionally coercive. 

                                1

      The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
    coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really
    “extend” Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely
    new program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE
    calls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of
    America’s poor than Congress originally covered.
    
      Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi­
    cal assistance to “needy persons.”  By bring­
    ing health care within the reach of a larger population of
    Americans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is
    an extension of that basic aim.
    
       The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions gov­
    erning operation of the program, setting conditions rang­
    ing from “Limitation on payments to States for expend-
    itures attributable to taxes,” to “Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted
    for permanent residence.” The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast
    majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the
    existing program and specifies the rate at which States
    will be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene-
    ficiaries.  The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the
    program for these newly eligible persons; for that infor­
    mation, one must read the existing Medicaid Act. 

       Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expan­
    sion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a “new”
    health-care program. To the four categories of beneficiar­ies for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the
    three mandatory classes added in the late 1980’s, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals
    under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal
    poverty level. The expansion is effectuated by §2001 of the
    ACA, aptly titled: “Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest
    Income Populations.” That section amends
    Title 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for
    Medical Assistance Programs. Commonly known as the
    Medicaid Act, Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in 2006. Section 2001 of the ACA would add approximately three pages.

       Congress has broad authority to construct or adjust
    spending programs to meet its contemporary understand­
    ing of “the general Welfare.” Courts owe a large measure of re­
    spect to Congress’ characterization of the grant programs
    it establishes. Even if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress’
    conception of the character of its legislation, how would
    reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, pur­porting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment,
    but a new creation? At what point does an extension
    become so large that it “transforms” the basic law?
    
       Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new pro­
    gram, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites three aspects of the ex­pansion. First, he asserts that, in covering those earning no more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medi­caid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not “care for the neediest among us.”  What makes
    that so? Single adults earning no more than $14,856 per
    year---133% of the current federal poverty level---surely
    rank among the Nation’s poor.
    
       Second, according to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, “Congress
    mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of
    coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional
    Medicaid benefit package.” That less comprehensive
    benefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced
    by the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for
    many of their Medicaid beneficiaries. The level of bene­fits offered therefore does not set apart post-ACA Medicaid
    recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre-ACA.

       Third, THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly notes that the
    reimbursement rate for participating States is differ­ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid-eligible
    through the ACA. Ibid. But the rate differs only in its
    generosity to participating States. Under pre-ACA Medi­
    caid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs
    of coverage for current enrollees; under the ACA, the federal contribution starts
    at 100% and will eventually settle at 90%. Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percent­
    age points carries constitutional significance, is it not
    passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on
    state sovereignty might have been averted, or at least
    mitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry
    out the same obligations?
    
       Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medi­
    caid. Thereafter, Congress
    could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin­ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage
    required by the ACA. By what right does a court stop
    Congress from building up without first tearing down?

                                 2

      THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the Medicaid expansion vul­
    nerable because it took participating States by surprise. “A State could hardly anticipate that Con­
    gres[s]” would endeavor to “transform [the Medicaid pro­
    gram] so dramatically,” he states. For the
    notion that States must be able to foresee, when they sign
    up, alterations Congress might make later on, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites only one case: Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman.
    
       In Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded
    institution for the mentally disabled complained of abu­sive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged viola­tion of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill
    of Rights Act. We held that the State
    was not answerable in damages for violating conditions
    it did not “voluntarily and knowingly accep[t].” Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his­tory, we found that the Act did not “unambiguously” im­pose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that
    they receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive
    environment. Satisfied that Congress had
    not clearly conditioned the States’ receipt of federal funds
    on the States’ provision of such treatment, we declined to
    read such a requirement into the Act. Congress’ spending
    power, we concluded, “does not include surprising partici­pating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ condi­tions.” 

       Pennhurst thus instructs that “if Congress intends to
    impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must
    do so unambiguously.” That requirement is met in this case.
    Section 2001 does not take effect until 2014. The ACA
    makes perfectly clear what will be required of States that
    accept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend
    eligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of
    the federal poverty line. 

       THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to find in Pennhurst a
    requirement that, when spending legislation is first
    passed, or when States first enlist in the federal program,
    Congress must provide clear notice of conditions it might
    later impose. If I understand his point correctly, it was
    incumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might take. And absent such notice, sizable changes could not be
    made mandatory. Our decisions do not support such a
    requirement. When amendment of an existing grant program has no retroactive effect, however, we have upheld Congress’ instruction. [analysis of cases omitted]

        As these decisions show, Pennhurst’s rule demands that
    conditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the
    time a State receives and uses the money—not at the time,
    perhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law
    establishing the program. 

        In any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put
    States on notice that the program could be changed: “The
    right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medi­
    caid],” the statute has read since 1965, “is hereby reserved
    to the Congress.” The “effect of these
    few simple words” has long been settled.  By reserving the
    right to “alter, amend, [or] repeal” a spending program,
    Congress “has given special notice of its intention to retain
    . . . full and complete power to make such alterations and
    amendments . . . as come within the just scope of legisla­
    tive power.” 

       THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists that the most recent expan­
    sion, in contrast to its predecessors, “accomplishes a shift
    in kind, not merely degree." But why was
    Medicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Con­
    gress required States to cover millions of children and
    pregnant women? Congress did not
    “merely alte[r] and expan[d] the boundaries of ” the Aid to
    Families with Dependent Children program. Rather, Congress required participating States
    to provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level (as it
    later did in the ACA), rather than to the AFDC program.
    In short, given §1304, this Court’s con­
    struction of §1304’s language in Bowen, and the enlarge­
    ment of Medicaid in the years since 1965, a State would
    be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when,
    in 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger
    portion of the Nation’s poor.
    
                                 3


       When future Spending Clause challenges arrive, as they
    likely will in the wake of today’s decision, how will liti­gants and judges assess whether “a State has a legitimate
    choice whether to accept the federal conditions in ex­change for federal funds”? Are courts to
    measure the number of dollars the Federal Government
    might withhold for noncompliance? The portion of the
    State’s budget at stake? And which State’s—or States’—budget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging
    States (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal
    situations), or some national median? Does it matter that
    Florida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax,
    and therefore might be able to replace foregone federal
    funds with new state revenue? Or that the coercion state officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for
    turning down a politically popular federal grant?
    
       The coercion inquiry, therefore, appears to involve polit-
    ical judgments that defy judicial calculation. See Baker v. Carr. Even commentators
    sympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole’s limitations have concluded that conceptions of
    “impermissible coercion” premised on States’ perceived
    inability to decline federal funds “are just too amorphous
    to be judicially administrable.” 

       At bottom, my colleagues’ position is that the States’
    reliance on federal funds limits Congress’ authority to
    alter its spending programs. This gets things backwards:
    Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal
    money in service of the general welfare. And each succes­
    sive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees
    fit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about
    Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors’ view,
    it abridged no State’s right to “existing,” or “pre-existing,”
    funds. In fact, there are no such funds. There is only money States
    anticipate receiving from future Congresses.

                                II

                         The Taxing Power

The Government contends, however, as expressed
    in the caption to Part II of its brief, that “THE MINIMUM
    COVERAGE PROVISION IS INDEPENDENTLY AUTHORIZED BY
    CONGRESS’S TAXING POWER.”  The phrase “independently authorized”
    suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen
    in the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional
    purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes. In
    all our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty
    or else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been
    imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was imposed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a
    regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know
    of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the
    imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both. The
    two are mutually exclusive. Thus, what the Government’s
    caption should have read was “ALTERNATIVELY, THE
    MINIMUM COVERAGE PROVISION IS NOT A MANDATE-WITH-
    PENALTY BUT A TAX.” It is important to bear this in mind
    in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of
    those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision
    as a tax, but whether it did so.
      In answering that question we must, if “fairly possible,” construe the
    provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty,
    since that would render it constitutional rather than un-
    constitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat). But we
    cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. “ ‘ “[A]l-
    though this Court will often strain to construe legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, it
    must not and will not carry this to the point of perverting
    the purpose of a statute . . .” or judicially rewriting it.’” In this case, there is
    simply no way, “without doing violence to the fair meaning
    of the words used,”  to escape what Congress
    enacted: a mandate that individuals maintain minimum
    essential coverage, enforced by a penalty.
    
      Our cases establish a clear line between a tax and a
    penalty: “ ‘[A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for
    the support of government; a penalty . . . is an exaction
    imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.’ ” In a few cases, this
    Court has held that a “tax” imposed upon private conduct
    was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty. But we have
    never held—never—that a penalty imposed for violation of
    the law was so trivial as to be in effect a tax. We have
    never held that any exaction imposed for violation of
    the law is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power—even
    when the statute calls it a tax, much less when (as here)
    the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty. When an act “adopt[s] the criteria of wrongdoing” and then imposes a
    monetary penalty as the “principal consequence on those
    who transgress its standard,” it creates a regulatory pen-
    alty, not a tax. 

       So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction
    here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. The minimum-coverage provision is found in §5000A, entitled “Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.” It commands that every “applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the
    individual . . . is covered under minimum essential coverage.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And the immediately following provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable
    individual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection
    (a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.”  And several of Congress’ legislative “findings” with regard to §5000A confirm that it sets forth
    a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere taxing power. See  §18091(2)(A) (“The requirement regulates activity . . .”);
    §18091(2)(C) (“The requirement . . . will add millions of
    new consumers to the health insurance market . . .”);
    §18091(2)(D) (“The requirement achieves near-universal
    coverage”); §18091(2)(H) (“The requirement is an essential
    part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the
    absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market”); §18091(3) (“[T]he
    Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance
    is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation”).
    
       The Government and those who support its view on the
    tax point rely on New York v. United States, to justify reading “shall” to mean “may.” The “shall” in
    that case was contained in an introductory provision—a
    recital that provided for no legal consequences—which
    said that “[e]ach State shall be responsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low-level radioactive waste.”  The Court did not hold that
    “shall” could be construed to mean “may,” but rather that
    this preliminary provision could not impose upon the operative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not
    contain: “We . . . decline petitioners’ invitation to construe §2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a command to the States independent of the remainder of the
    Act.” Our opinion then
    proceeded to “consider each [of the three operative provisions] in turn.” Here the mandate—the “shall”---is
    contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital, but in
    the dispositive operative provision itself. New York provides no support for reading it to be permissive.
    
        Quite separately, the fact that Congress (in its own
    words) “imposed . . . a penalty” for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render
    that failure unlawful. It is one of the canons of interpreta-
    tion that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlawful: “[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act,
    although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do
    the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the
    Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for
    a lawful act.” Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R.
    Co. (1861). 

We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed
    for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself
    as a penalty. To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a
    tax a statutory exaction (imposed for something other
    than a violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that
    does not entail the significant constitutional consequences of a penalty—such as “license” (License Tax Cases (1867)) or “surcharge” (New York v. United States). But we have never—never—treated as a tax an
    exaction which faces up to the critical difference between
    a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exaction a “penalty.” Eighteen times in §5000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in
    §5000A(b) a “penalty.”
    
       That §5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to
    which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact
    that some are exempt from the tax who are not exempt from the mandate---a distinction that would make
    no sense if the mandate were not a mandate. Section
    5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the definition of “applicable individual” subject to the minimum
    coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or
    who participate in a “health care sharing ministry”; those who are “not lawfully present” in the
    United States); and those who are incarcerated. Section 5000A(e) then creates a separate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the
    penalty certain individuals who are subject to the minimum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford
    coverage; who earn too little income to require filing a tax return; who are members
    of an Indian tribe; who experience only short
    gaps in coverage; and who, in the judgment
    of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “have
    suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain
    coverage." If §5000A were a tax, these two
    classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no
    requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the penalty (renamed tax) alone.
    
       In the face of all these indications of a regulatory re-
    quirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General
    assures us that “neither the Treasury Department nor the Department of Health and Human Services interprets
    Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation,” and that “[i]f [those subject
    to the Act] pay the tax penalty, they’re in compliance with
    the law,” These self-serving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.
    What counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely
    clear. 

Against the mountain of evidence that the minimum
    coverage requirement is what the statute calls it---a requirement—and that the penalty for its violation is what
    the statute calls it---a penalty—the Government brings
    forward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary. It
    notes that “[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the
    Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted
    individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to
    the income tax itself,” and that “[t]he [Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the
    same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal Revenue Code.” 

The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if
    IRS penalty-collection were unheard-of or rare. It is not.
    See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. §527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible penalty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures);
    §5761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of tobacco products labeled for export); §9707 (IRS-collectible
    penalty for failure to make required health-insurance
    premium payments on behalf of mining employees). In
    Reorganized CF&I; Fabricators of Utah, Inc., we held that an exaction not only enforced by the
    Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a “tax”
    was in fact a penalty. “[I]f the concept of penalty means
    anything,” we said, “it means punishment for an unlawful
    act or omission.”  Moreover, while the penalty
    is assessed and collected by the IRS, §5000A is administered both by that agency and by the Department of
    Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of
    Veteran Affairs), which is responsible for
    defining its substantive scope---a feature that would be
    quite extraordinary for taxes.
    
       The Government points out that “[t]he amount of the
    penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household
    income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor
    and [a] ca[p],” and that individuals who earn so little
    money that they “are not required to file income tax returns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty”
    (though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the
    mandate) But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an
    utterly familiar practice. [citing a bunch of examples 

      The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petitioners that we will address is the contention that what this
    statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it
    contains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a
    requirement suggests a penalty---though one can imagine
    a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of
    such a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for
    absolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a
    statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume
    a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a “severe
    penalty.” Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing
    when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred
    from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a
    penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter
    requirement.
    
      And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and penalty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,
    rather than where a tax would be found---in Title IX,
    containing the Act’s “Revenue Provisions.” In sum, “the
    terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,”that Congress imposed a
    regulatory penalty, not a tax.
    
      For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute
    but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act
    of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution
    requires tax increases to originate in the House of Representatives. That is to say, they must
    originate in the legislative body most accountable to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next
    election, which is never more than two years off. The
    Federalist No. 58 “defend[ed] the decision to give the
    origination power to the House on the ground that the
    Chamber that is more accountable to the people should
    have the primary role in raising revenue.”  We have no
    doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing
    when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that
    imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.
    
       Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax
    in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to
    confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is
    a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States
    according to their population. Art. I, §9, Perhaps it
    is not (we have no need to address the point); but the
    meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and
    its application here is a question of first impression that
    deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-
    a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.
    

                                 IV

                     The Medicaid Expansion

                                 F

      Seven Members of the Court agree that the Medicaid
    Expansion, as enacted by Congress, is unconstitutional. Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,
    the question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,
    the Government proposes—in two cursory sentences at
    the very end of its brief—preserving the Expansion. Under
    its proposal, States would receive the additional Medicaid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not
    expand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government’s
    suggestion.
    
       The reality that States were given no real choice but to
    expand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed
    States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on
    States’ having no choice, because its Mandate requires
    low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them
    can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Furthermore, a State’s withdrawal might subject everyone in
    the State to much higher insurance premiums. That is
    because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the
    cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA’s insurance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in
    more detail in the severability section below. To make the
    Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA’s structure
    and design “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce
    an old one. This is no part of our duty.’ 

       Worse, the Government’s proposed remedy introduces a
    new dynamic: States must choose between expanding
    Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for
    the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If
    this divisive dynamic between and among States can be
    introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional
    choice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not
    doubt that States are capable of making decisions when
    put in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this
    Court to put them there.

       The Government cites a severability clause codified with
    Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating that if “any provision of this chapter, or the application
    thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the
    remainder of the chapter, and the application of such
    provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
    affected thereby.”  But that
    clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7
    should not be invalidated if §1396c, the authorization for
    the cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It
    does not tell us that §1396c can be judicially revised, to
    say what it does not say. Such a judicial power would
    not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps
    the doctrine of amendatory invalidation---similar to the
    amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some
    States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.
    The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that
    it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but
    would leave it up to the Court what the “validated” legislation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting
    the cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it
    might just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds
    that represent no more than x percent of the State’s budget. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises §1396c to
    read as the Court would desire.
    
       We should not accept the Government’s invitation to
    attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the
    Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it
    to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the
    Government’s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes
    the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a
    course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has
    chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and authority do not rest with this Court.
    
                               V
                               
                          Severability
                          
         The Affordable Care Act seeks to achieve “near-universal” health insurance coverage. The two pillars of the Act are the Individ-
    ual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.
    In our view, both these central provisions of the Act—the
    Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion—are invalid.
    It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provisions of the Act must fall as well. The following section
    explains the severability principles that require this conclusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated
    the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial
    usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for
    withdrawal of Medicaid funding which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act
    alters its dynamics.
    
                                    A

       When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a
    more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the
    validity of the remaining provisions. The Court’s authority to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been
    well established since Marbury v. Madison, when the Court severed an unconstitutional provi-
    sion from the Judiciary Act of 1789. 

       An automatic or too cursory severance of statutory
    provisions risks “rewrit[ing] a statute and giv[ing] it an
    effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole.”  The Judiciary, if it
    orders uncritical severance, then assumes the legislative
    function; for it imposes on the Nation, by the Court’s
    decree, its own new statutory regime, consisting of policies, risks, and duties that Congress did not enact. That
    can be a more extreme exercise of the judicial power than
    striking the whole statute and allowing Congress to address the conditions that pertained when the statute was considered at the outset.
    
       The Court has applied a two-part guide as the framework for severability analysis. First, if the Court holds a statutory
    provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether
    the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con-
    gress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be
    invalidated. In Alaska Airlines, the Court
    clarified that this first inquiry requires more than asking whether “the balance of the legislation is incapable of
    functioning independently.” Even if the remaining provisions will operate in some coherent way,
    that alone does not save the statute. The question is
    whether the provisions will work as Congress intended.
    

       Second, even if the remaining provisions can operate as
    Congress designed them to operate, the Court must determine if Congress would have enacted them standing alone and without the unconstitutional portion. If Congress would not, those provisions, too, must be invalidated.

       The two inquiries---whether the remaining provisions
    will operate as Congress designed them, and whether
    Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions
    standing alone---often are interrelated. In the ordinary
    course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate accord-
    ing to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost
    necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted
    them (the second inquiry). This close interaction may
    explain why the Court has not always been precise in
    distinguishing between the two. There are, however,
    occasions in which the severability standard’s first inquiry
    (statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second
    inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining
    provisions to stand alone).
    
                               B
    
      The Act was passed to enable affordable, “near-universal”
    health insurance coverage. The resulting, complex statute consists of mandates and other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penalties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some governmental expenditures, decreases in others. Under the
    severability test set out above, it must be determined if
    those provisions function in a coherent way and as Congress would have intended, even when the major provisions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion are themselves invalid.
    
       Congress did not intend to establish the goal of near-universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.
    See, e.g., ACA §1563 (“[T]his Act will reduce
    the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019”). And it did
    not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one industry or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act
    is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set
    of regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to
    obtain health insurance. Insurance companies are required to sell them insurance regardless of patients’ pre-existing conditions and to comply
    with a host of other regulations. And the companies must
    pay new taxes. States are expected to expand Medicaid
    eligibility and to create regulated marketplaces called exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance.  Some persons
    who cannot afford insurance are provided it through the
    Medicaid Expansion, and others are aided in their purchase of insurance through federal subsidies available on health-insurance exchanges.The Federal Government’s increased spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal
    expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in
    federal payments to hospitals. Employers with at least 50
    employees must either provide employees with adequate
    health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee
    who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance
    through an exchange. 

       In short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal
    health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to individuals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers---while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions
    of those costs with new benefits to each group. For example, the Federal Government bears the burden of paying billions for the new entitlements mandated by the
    Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance
    purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reductions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospitals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the
    decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance
    regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing
    conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments
    to hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed
    by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including
    “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” requirements
    to give coverage regardless of the insured’s pre-existing
    conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy
    purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate
    to buy the insurers’ product and from the new low-income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance
    companies’ Medicaid-funded managed care programs. In
    summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset
    reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset increases in federal spending. So, the Act’s major provisions are interdependent.
    
      The Act then refers to these interdependencies as
    “shared responsibility.”  In at least six places, the Act describes the Individual Mandate as working “together with the other provisions of this Act.” The Act calls the Individual Mandate “an essential part” of federal regulation of health
    insurance and warns that “the absence of the requirement
    would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance
    market.” 

      Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act---i.e., the
    insurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal
    reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend-
    ing reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies,
    and the employer responsibility assessment---cannot remain
    once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are
    invalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability
    of the other major provisions to operate as Congress in-
    tended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major
    provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected burdens on patients, the health-care community, and the
    federal budget. That consequence would be in absolute
    conflict with the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility,”
    and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did not intend.

       Without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion, the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations and
    insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and
    their customers that this Court cannot measure. Those
    risks would undermine Congress’ scheme of “shared responsibility.” 

       The Court has been informed by distinguished economists that the Act’s Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance
    industry by about $350 billion over 10 years; that this
    combined figure of $700 billion is necessary to offset the
    approximately $700 billion in new costs to the insurance
    industry imposed by the Act’s insurance regulations and
    taxes; and that the new $700-billion burden would otherwise dwarf the industry’s current profit margin. 

       If that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will
    mean higher costs for insurance companies. Higher costs
    may mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the
    Act’s goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums.” 


      The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Fed-
    eral Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion
    over 10 years. 
    
      The concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage
    will reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hospitals’ revenues, which will offset the government’s reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to
    hospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and
    benefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole
    dynamic of the Act.
    
      Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insurance coverage, such as community rating and the Medicaid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in
    Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA’s design of
    “shared responsibility.” Some hospitals may be forced to
    raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in
    reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance
    premiums, in contravention of the Act’s goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums.” [Anyway, you get the picture: the dissenters flesh out this argument at somewhat greater length.]


       The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did
    not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a
    requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject
    to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanction of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly
    noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the
    Act makes available.
    
       The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation
    as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast
    judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable
    version of health-care regulation that Congress did not
    enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment
    of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since
    Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of
    departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions
    that certain interests favored under the Court’s new design will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and
    the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements
    that may or may not survive the necessary congressional
    revision.
    
       The Court’s disposition, invented and atextual as it is,
    does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional
    difficulties. It creates them. The holding that the Individual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional
    question (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves
    with inadequate deliberation. And the judgment on the
    Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism concerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.
    
    Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must
    subsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their
    citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid
    Expansion. If that destabilizing political dynamic, so
    antagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at
    all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.

       The values that should have determined our course today are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that
    the Federal Government is one of limited powers. But
    the Court’s ruling undermines those values at every turn.
    In the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of
    constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional
    questions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it undermines state sovereignty.
