    No. 11–393.      Argued March 26, 27, 28, 2012—Decided June 28, 2012*
    In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
      Act in order to increase the number of Americans covered by health
      insurance and decrease the cost of health care. One key provision is
      the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to maintain
      “minimum essential” health insurance coverage. 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A.
      For individuals who are not exempt, and who do not receive health
      insurance through an employer or government program, the means of
      satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a private
      company. Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the
      mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment” to the Fed-
      eral Government. §5000A(b)(1). The Act provides that this “penalty”
      will be paid to the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s tax-
      es, and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner” as tax
      penalties. §§5000A(c), (g)(1).
        Another key provision of the Act is the Medicaid expansion. The
      current Medicaid program offers federal funding to States to assist
      pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and
      the disabled in obtaining medical care. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396d(a). The
      Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medicaid program and
      increases the number of individuals the States must cover. For ex-

        ample, the Act requires state programs to provide Medicaid coverage
        by 2014 to adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal pov-
        erty level, whereas many States now cover adults with children only
        if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover childless adults
        at all. §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act increases federal funding to
        cover the States’ costs in expanding Medicaid coverage. §1396d(y)(1).
        But if a State does not comply with the Act’s new coverage require-
        ments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those require-
        ments, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. §1396c.
           Twenty-six States, several individuals, and the National Federa-
        tion of Independent Business brought suit in Federal District Court,
        challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the
        Medicaid expansion. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
        upheld the Medicaid expansion as a valid exercise of Congress’s
        spending power, but concluded that Congress lacked authority to en-
        act the individual mandate. Finding the mandate severable from the
        Act’s other provisions, the Eleventh Circuit left the rest of the Act in-
        tact.
    Held: The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part.

    , affirmed in part and reversed in part.
        1. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with
      respect to Part II, concluding that the Anti-Injunction Act does not
      bar this suit.
        The Anti-Injunction Act provides that “no suit for the purpose of
      restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be main-
      tained in any court by any person,” 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §7421(a), so that those
      subject to a tax must first pay it and then sue for a refund. The pre-
      sent challenge seeks to restrain the collection of the shared responsi-
      bility payment from those who do not comply with the individual
      mandate. But Congress did not intend the payment to be treated as
      a “tax” for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. The Affordable Care
      Act describes the payment as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” That label
      cannot control whether the payment is a tax for purposes of the Con-
      stitution, but it does determine the application of the Anti-Injunction
      Act. The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not bar this suit. Pp. 11–
      15.
        2. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III–A that the indi-
      vidual mandate is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the
      Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Pp. 16–30.
           (a) The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate
      Commerce.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power to regulate
      commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be reg-
      ulated. This Court’s precedent reflects this understanding: As ex-
      pansive as this Court’s cases construing the scope of the commerce
                       Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                      3
    
                                  Syllabus
    
    power have been, they uniformly describe the power as reaching “ac-
    tivity.” E.g., United States v. Lopez, 

[514 U.S. 549](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    , 560. The individ-
    ual mandate, however, does not regulate existing commercial activi-
    ty. It instead compels individuals to become active in commerce by
    purchasing a product, on the ground that their failure to do so affects
    interstate commerce.
       Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate
    individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a
    new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Con-
    gress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do.
    Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause
    would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not
    do. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and
    doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce,
    not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the prin-
    ciple that the Federal Government is a government of limited and
    enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sus-
    tained under Congress’s power to “regulate Commerce.” Pp. 16–27.
          (b) Nor can the individual mandate be sustained under the Nec-
    essary and Proper Clause as an integral part of the Affordable Care
    Act’s other reforms. Each of this Court’s prior cases upholding laws
    under that Clause involved exercises of authority derivative of, and
    in service to, a granted power. E.g., United States v. Comstock, 560
    U. S. ___. The individual mandate, by contrast, vests Congress with
    the extraordinary ability to create the necessary predicate to the ex-
    ercise of an enumerated power and draw within its regulatory scope
    those who would otherwise be outside of it. Even if the individual
    mandate is “necessary” to the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms,
    such an expansion of federal power is not a “proper” means for mak-
    ing those reforms effective. Pp. 27–30.
       3. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS concluded in Part III–B that the individ-
    ual mandate must be construed as imposing a tax on those who do
    not have health insurance, if such a construction is reasonable.
       The most straightforward reading of the individual mandate is that
    it commands individuals to purchase insurance. But, for the reasons
    explained, the Commerce Clause does not give Congress that power.
    It is therefore necessary to turn to the Government’s alternative ar-
    gument: that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s power
    to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8, cl. 1. In pressing its taxing
    power argument, the Government asks the Court to view the man-
    date as imposing a tax on those who do not buy that product. Be-
    cause “every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to
    save a statute from unconstitutionality,” Hooper v. California, 

[155 U.S. 648](/opinion/94074/hooper-v-california/)

    
    
    , 657, the question is whether it is “fairly possible” to inter-

        pret the mandate as imposing such a tax, Crowell v. Benson, 

[285 U.S. 22](/opinion/101864/crowell-v-benson/)

    
    
    , 62. Pp. 31–32.
           4. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court with
        respect to Part III–C, concluding that the individual mandate may be
        upheld as within Congress’s power under the Taxing Clause. Pp. 33–
        44.
              (a) The Affordable Care Act describes the “[s]hared responsibility
        payment” as a “penalty,” not a “tax.” That label is fatal to the appli-
        cation of the Anti-Injunction Act. It does not, however, control
        whether an exaction is within Congress’s power to tax. In answering
        that constitutional question, this Court follows a functional approach,
        “[d]isregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its sub-
        stance and application.” United States v. Constantine, 

[296 U.S. 287](/opinion/102515/united-states-v-constantine/)

    
    
    ,
        294. Pp. 33–35.
              (b) Such an analysis suggests that the shared responsibility
        payment may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax. The
        payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health
        insurance; the payment is not limited to willful violations, as penal-
        ties for unlawful acts often are; and the payment is collected solely by
        the IRS through the normal means of taxation. Cf. Bailey v. Drexel
        Furniture Co., 

[259 U.S. 20](/opinion/99987/child-labor-tax-case/)

    
    
    , 36–37. None of this is to say that pay-
        ment is not intended to induce the purchase of health insurance. But
        the mandate need not be read to declare that failing to do so is un-
        lawful. Neither the Affordable Care Act nor any other law attaches
        negative legal consequences to not buying health insurance, beyond
        requiring a payment to the IRS. And Congress’s choice of language—
        stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance or pay a “penalty”—
        does not require reading §5000A as punishing unlawful conduct. It
        may also be read as imposing a tax on those who go without insur-
        ance. See New York v. United States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 169–174.
        Pp. 35–40.
              (c) Even if the mandate may reasonably be characterized as a
        tax, it must still comply with the Direct Tax Clause, which provides:
        “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion
        to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.”
        Art. I, §9, cl. 4. A tax on going without health insurance is not like a
        capitation or other direct tax under this Court’s precedents. It there-
        fore need not be apportioned so that each State pays in proportion to
        its population. Pp. 40–41.
           5. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS, joined by JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE
        KAGAN, concluded in Part IV that the Medicaid expansion violates
        the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing
        Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion.

          (a) The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay the
    Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.”
    Art. I, §8, cl. 1. Congress may use this power to establish cooperative
    state-federal Spending Clause programs. The legitimacy of Spending
    Clause legislation, however, depends on whether a State voluntarily
    and knowingly accepts the terms of such programs. Pennhurst State
    School and Hospital v. Halderman, 

[451 U.S. 1](/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/)

    
    
    , 17. “[T]he Constitu-
    tion simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States
    to regulate.” New York v. United States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 178. When
    Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressur-
    ing the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation
    runs counter to this Nation’s system of federalism. Cf. South Dakota
    v. Dole, 

[483 U.S. 203](/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/)

    
    
    , 211. Pp. 45–51.
          (b) Section 1396c gives the Secretary of Health and Human Ser-
    vices the authority to penalize States that choose not to participate in
    the Medicaid expansion by taking away their existing Medicaid fund-
    ing. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396c. The threatened loss of over 10 percent of a
    State’s overall budget is economic dragooning that leaves the States
    with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion. The
    Government claims that the expansion is properly viewed as only a
    modification of the existing program, and that this modification is
    permissible because Congress reserved the “right to alter, amend, or
    repeal any provision” of Medicaid. §1304. But the expansion accom-
    plishes a shift in kind, not merely degree. The original program was
    designed to cover medical services for particular categories of vulner-
    able individuals. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid is trans-
    formed into a program to meet the health care needs of the entire
    nonelderly population with income below 133 percent of the poverty
    level. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reservation of
    the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid program included the
    power to transform it so dramatically. The Medicaid expansion thus
    violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their
    existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expan-
    sion. Pp. 51–55.
          (c) The constitutional violation is fully remedied by precluding
    the Secretary from applying §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid
    funds for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the ex-
    pansion. See §1303. The other provisions of the Affordable Care Act
    are not affected. Congress would have wanted the rest of the Act to
    stand, had it known that States would have a genuine choice whether
    to participate in the Medicaid expansion. Pp. 55–58.
       6. JUSTICE GINSBURG, joined by JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, is of the view
    that the Spending Clause does not preclude the Secretary from with-
    holding Medicaid funds based on a State’s refusal to comply with the
    6            NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 
    
                         BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
    
                               Syllabus
    
    
        expanded Medicaid program. But given the majority view, she
        agrees with THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s conclusion in Part IV–B that the
        Medicaid Act’s severability clause, 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1303, determines the
        appropriate remedy. Because THE CHIEF JUSTICE finds the withhold-
        ing—not the granting—of federal funds incompatible with the Spend-
        ing Clause, Congress’ extension of Medicaid remains available to any
        State that affirms its willingness to participate. Even absent §1303’s
        command, the Court would have no warrant to invalidate the funding
        offered by the Medicaid expansion, and surely no basis to tear down
        the ACA in its entirety. When a court confronts an unconstitutional
        statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy, the legislation.

      Today we resolve constitutional challenges to two provi-
    sions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of
    2        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    2010: the individual mandate, which requires individuals
    to purchase a health insurance policy providing a mini-
    mum level of coverage; and the Medicaid expansion, which
    gives funds to the States on the condition that they pro-
    vide specified health care to all citizens whose income falls
    below a certain threshold. We do not consider whether the
    Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted
    to the Nation’s elected leaders. We ask only whether
    Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact
    the challenged provisions.
      In our federal system, the National Government pos-
    sesses only limited powers; the States and the people
    retain the remainder. Nearly two centuries ago, Chief
    Justice Marshall observed that “the question respecting
    the extent of the powers actually granted” to the Federal
    Government “is perpetually arising, and will probably
    continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist.”
    McCulloch v. Maryland, 

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 405 (1819). In this
    case we must again determine whether the Constitution
    grants Congress powers it now asserts, but which many
    States and individuals believe it does not possess. Resolv-
    ing this controversy requires us to examine both the limits
    of the Government’s power, and our own limited role in
    policing those boundaries.
      The Federal Government “is acknowledged by all to
    be one of enumerated powers.” Ibid. That is, rather
    than granting general authority to perform all the conceiv-
    able functions of government, the Constitution lists, or

    may, for example, “coin Money,” “establish Post Offices,”
    and “raise and support Armies.” Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 7, 12.
    The enumeration of powers is also a limitation of pow-
    ers, because “[t]he enumeration presupposes something not
    enumerated.” Gibbons v. Ogden,

    Government “can exercise only the powers granted to it.”
    McCulloch, supra, at 405.
       Today, the restrictions on government power foremost in
    many Americans’ minds are likely to be affirmative pro-
    hibitions, such as contained in the Bill of Rights. These
    affirmative prohibitions come into play, however, only where
    the Government possesses authority to act in the first
    place. If no enumerated power authorizes Congress to
    pass a certain law, that law may not be enacted, even if it
    would not violate any of the express prohibitions in the
    Bill of Rights or elsewhere in the Constitution.
       Indeed, the Constitution did not initially include a Bill
    of Rights at least partly because the Framers felt the enu-
    meration of powers sufficed to restrain the Government.
    As Alexander Hamilton put it, “the Constitution is itself,
    in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose,
    A BILL OF RIGHTS.” The Federalist No. 84, p. 515 (C. Ros-
    siter ed. 1961). And when the Bill of Rights was ratified,
    it made express what the enumeration of powers neces-
    sarily implied: “The powers not delegated to the United
    States by the Constitution . . . are reserved to the States
    respectively, or to the people.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.
    The Federal Government has expanded dramatically over
    the past two centuries, but it still must show that a consti-
    tutional grant of power authorizes each of its actions. See,
    e.g., United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010).
       The same does not apply to the States, because the Con-
    stitution is not the source of their power. The Consti-
    tution may restrict state governments—as it does, for
    example, by forbidding them to deny any person the equal
    protection of the laws. But where such prohibitions do
    not apply, state governments do not need constitutional au-
    thorization to act. The States thus can and do perform
    many of the vital functions of modern government—
    punishing street crime, running public schools, and zoning
    property for development, to name but a few—even though

    the Constitution’s text does not authorize any government
    to do so. Our cases refer to this general power of govern-
    ing, possessed by the States but not by the Federal Gov-
    ernment, as the “police power.” See, e.g., United States v.
    Morrison, 

[529 U.S. 598](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    , 618–619 (2000).
       “State sovereignty is not just an end in itself: Rather,
    federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from
    the diffusion of sovereign power.” New York v. United
    States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 181 (1992) (internal quotation
    marks omitted). Because the police power is controlled by
    50 different States instead of one national sovereign, the
    facets of governing that touch on citizens’ daily lives are
    normally administered by smaller governments closer to
    the governed. The Framers thus ensured that powers
    which “in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives,
    liberties, and properties of the people” were held by gov-
    ernments more local and more accountable than a dis-
    tant federal bureaucracy. The Federalist No. 45, at 293
    (J. Madison). The independent power of the States also
    serves as a check on the power of the Federal Government:
    “By denying any one government complete jurisdiction
    over all the concerns of public life, federalism protects the
    liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.” Bond v.
    United States, 

[564 U.S. ](/opinion/218927/bond-v-united-states/)

    
    
    ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9–10).
       This case concerns two powers that the Constitution
    does grant the Federal Government, but which must be
    read carefully to avoid creating a general federal authority
    akin to the police power. The Constitution authorizes
    Congress to “regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and
    among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.”
    Art. I, §8, cl. 3. Our precedents read that to mean that
    Congress may regulate “the channels of interstate com-
    merce,” “persons or things in interstate commerce,” and
    “those activities that substantially affect interstate com-
    merce.” Morrison, supra, at 609 (internal quotation marks
    omitted). The power over activities that substantially
                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)            5
    
                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    affect interstate commerce can be expansive. That power
    has been held to authorize federal regulation of such seem-
    ingly local matters as a farmer’s decision to grow wheat
    for himself and his livestock, and a loan shark’s extor-
    tionate collections from a neighborhood butcher shop.
    See Wickard v. Filburn, 

[317 U.S. 111](/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/)

    United States, 

[402 U.S. 146](/opinion/108326/perez-v-united-states/)

    
    
     (1971).
       Congress may also “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Im-
    posts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the
    common Defence and general Welfare of the United
    States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1. Put simply, Con-
    gress may tax and spend. This grant gives the Federal
    Government considerable influence even in areas where
    it cannot directly regulate. The Federal Government may
    enact a tax on an activity that it cannot authorize, forbid,
    or otherwise control. See, e.g., License Tax Cases, 

[5 Wall. 462](/opinion/87845/license-tax-cases/)

    
    
    , 471 (1867). And in exercising its spending power,
    Congress may offer funds to the States, and may condition
    those offers on compliance with specified conditions. See,
    e.g., College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecond-
    ary Ed. Expense Bd., 

[527 U.S. 666](/opinion/118317/college-savings-bank-v-florida-prepaid-
postsecondary-ed-expense-bd/)

    
    
    , 686 (1999). These
    offers may well induce the States to adopt policies that
    the Federal Government itself could not impose. See, e.g.,
    South Dakota v. Dole, 

[483 U.S. 203](/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/)

    
    
    , 205–206 (1987) (con-
    ditioning federal highway funds on States raising their
    drinking age to 21).
       The reach of the Federal Government’s enumerated
    powers is broader still because the Constitution authorizes
    Congress to “make all Laws which shall be necessary and
    proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers.”
    Art. I, §8, cl. 18. We have long read this provision to give
    Congress great latitude in exercising its powers: “Let the
    end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitu-
    tion, and all means which are appropriate, which are
    plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
    consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are

    constitutional.” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 421.
       Our permissive reading of these powers is explained in
    part by a general reticence to invalidate the acts of the
    Nation’s elected leaders. “Proper respect for a co-ordinate
    branch of the government” requires that we strike down
    an Act of Congress only if “the lack of constitutional
    authority to pass [the] act in question is clearly demon-
    strated.” United States v. Harris, 

[106 U.S. 629](/opinion/90728/united-states-v-harris/)

    
    
    , 635 (1883).
    Members of this Court are vested with the authority to
    interpret the law; we possess neither the expertise nor
    the prerogative to make policy judgments. Those decisions
    are entrusted to our Nation’s elected leaders, who can be
    thrown out of office if the people disagree with them. It is
    not our job to protect the people from the consequences of
    their political choices.
       Our deference in matters of policy cannot, however,
    become abdication in matters of law. “The powers of the
    legislature are defined and limited; and that those lim-
    its may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is
    written.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803).
    Our respect for Congress’s policy judgments thus can
    never extend so far as to disavow restraints on federal
    power that the Constitution carefully constructed. “The
    peculiar circumstances of the moment may render a
    measure more or less wise, but cannot render it more or
    less constitutional.” Chief Justice John Marshall, A
    Friend of the Constitution No. V, Alexandria Gazette, July
    5, 1819, in John Marshall’s Defense of McCulloch v. Mary-
    land 190–191 (G. Gunther ed. 1969). And there can be no
    question that it is the responsibility of this Court to en-
    force the limits on federal power by striking down acts of
    Congress that transgress those limits. Marbury v. Madi-
    son, supra, at 175–176.
       The questions before us must be considered against the
    background of these basic principles.

                                 I
       In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act, 124 Stat. 119. The Act aims to in-
    crease the number of Americans covered by health in-
    surance and decrease the cost of health care. The Act’s 10
    titles stretch over 900 pages and contain hundreds of
    provisions. This case concerns constitutional challenges to
    two key provisions, commonly referred to as the individual
    mandate and the Medicaid expansion.
       The individual mandate requires most Americans to
    maintain “minimum essential” health insurance coverage.
    

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A. The mandate does not apply to some
    individuals, such as prisoners and undocumented aliens.
    §5000A(d). Many individuals will receive the required cov-
    erage through their employer, or from a government pro-
    gram such as Medicaid or Medicare. See §5000A(f). But
    for individuals who are not exempt and do not receive
    health insurance through a third party, the means of
    satisfying the requirement is to purchase insurance from a
    private company.
       Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the
    mandate must make a “[s]hared responsibility payment”
    to the Federal Government. §5000A(b)(1). That payment,
    which the Act describes as a “penalty,” is calculated as a
    percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on
    a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the aver-
    age annual premium the individual would have to pay for
    qualifying private health insurance. §5000A(c). In 2016,
    for example, the penalty will be 2.5 percent of an individ-
    ual’s household income, but no less than $695 and no more
    than the average yearly premium for insurance that co-
    vers 60 percent of the cost of 10 specified services (e.g.,
    prescription drugs and hospitalization). Ibid.; 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §18022. The Act provides that the penalty will be paid to
    the Internal Revenue Service with an individual’s taxes,
    and “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner”

    Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its nor-
    mal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and
    levies. §5000A(g)(2). And some individuals who are sub-
    ject to the mandate are nonetheless exempt from the
    penalty—for example, those with income below a certain
    threshold and members of Indian tribes. §5000A(e).
       On the day the President signed the Act into law, Flor-
    ida and 12 other States filed a complaint in the Federal
    District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Those
    plaintiffs—who are both respondents and petitioners here,
    depending on the issue—were subsequently joined by 13
    more States, several individuals, and the National Fed-
    eration of Independent Business. The plaintiffs alleged,
    among other things, that the individual mandate provi-
    sions of the Act exceeded Congress’s powers under Article
    I of the Constitution. The District Court agreed, holding
    that Congress lacked constitutional power to enact the
    individual mandate.

     (ND Fla. 2011).
    The District Court determined that the individual man-
    date could not be severed from the remainder of the Act,
    and therefore struck down the Act in its entirety. Id., at
    1305–1306.
       The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed
    in part and reversed in part. The court affirmed the Dis-
    trict Court’s holding that the individual mandate exceeds
    Congress’s power.

     (2011). The panel
    unanimously agreed that the individual mandate did not
    impose a tax, and thus could not be authorized by Con-
    gress’s power to “lay and collect Taxes.” U. S. Const.,
    Art. I, §8, cl. 1. A majority also held that the individual
    mandate was not supported by Congress’s power to “regu-
    late Commerce . . . among the several States.” Id., cl. 3.
    According to the majority, the Commerce Clause does not
    empower the Federal Government to order individuals to

    engage in commerce, and the Government’s efforts to cast
    the individual mandate in a different light were unpersua-
    sive. Judge Marcus dissented, reasoning that the individ-
    ual mandate regulates economic activity that has a clear
    effect on interstate commerce.
       Having held the individual mandate to be unconstitu-
    tional, the majority examined whether that provision
    could be severed from the remainder of the Act. The ma-
    jority determined that, contrary to the District Court’s
    view, it could. The court thus struck down only the indi-
    vidual mandate, leaving the Act’s other provisions intact.

       Other Courts of Appeals have also heard challenges to
    the individual mandate. The Sixth Circuit and the D. C.
    Circuit upheld the mandate as a valid exercise of Con-
    gress’s commerce power. See Thomas More Law Center v.
    Obama,

[661 F.3d 1](/opinion/616874/seven-sky-v-holder/)

    
    
     (CADC 2011). The Fourth Circuit determined
    that the Anti-Injunction Act prevents courts from consid-
    ering the merits of that question. See Liberty Univ., Inc.
    v. Geithner, 

671 F.3d 391

    
    
     (2011). That statute bars suits
    “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection
    of any tax.” 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §7421(a). A majority of the Fourth
    Circuit panel reasoned that the individual mandate’s
    penalty is a tax within the meaning of the Anti-Injunction
    Act, because it is a financial assessment collected by the
    IRS through the normal means of taxation. The majority
    therefore determined that the plaintiffs could not chal-
    lenge the individual mandate until after they paid the
    penalty.1
    ——————
      1 The Eleventh Circuit did not consider whether the Anti-Injunction
    
    Act bars challenges to the individual mandate. The District Court had
    determined that it did not, and neither side challenged that holding on
    appeal. The same was true in the Fourth Circuit, but that court
    examined the question sua sponte because it viewed the Anti-Injunction
    Act as a limit on its subject matter jurisdiction. See Liberty Univ., 671

       The second provision of the Affordable Care Act directly
    challenged here is the Medicaid expansion. Enacted in
    1965, Medicaid offers federal funding to States to assist
    pregnant women, children, needy families, the blind, the
    elderly, and the disabled in obtaining medical care. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396a(a)(10). In order to receive that funding,
    States must comply with federal criteria governing mat-
    ters such as who receives care and what services are pro-
    vided at what cost. By 1982 every State had chosen to
    participate in Medicaid. Federal funds received through
    the Medicaid program have become a substantial part of
    state budgets, now constituting over 10 percent of most
    States’ total revenue.
       The Affordable Care Act expands the scope of the Medi-
    caid program and increases the number of individuals the
    States must cover. For example, the Act requires state
    programs to provide Medicaid coverage to adults with
    incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level,
    whereas many States now cover adults with children only
    if their income is considerably lower, and do not cover
    childless adults at all. See §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The
    Act increases federal funding to cover the States’ costs in
    expanding Medicaid coverage, although States will bear a
    portion of the costs on their own. §1396d(y)(1). If a State
    does not comply with the Act’s new coverage require-
    ments, it may lose not only the federal funding for those
    requirements, but all of its federal Medicaid funds. See
    §1396c.
       Along with their challenge to the individual mandate,
    the state plaintiffs in the Eleventh Circuit argued that the
    Medicaid expansion exceeds Congress’s constitutional

    the Medicaid expansion.

      We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the

    both the individual mandate and the Medicaid expansion.
    565 U. S. ___ (2011). Because no party supports the Elev-
    enth Circuit’s holding that the individual mandate can
    be completely severed from the remainder of the Affordable
    Care Act, we appointed an amicus curiae to defend that
    aspect of the judgment below. And because there is a
    reasonable argument that the Anti-Injunction Act de-
    prives us of jurisdiction to hear challenges to the individ-
    ual mandate, but no party supports that proposition, we
    appointed an amicus curiae to advance it.2

       Before turning to the merits, we need to be sure we have
    the authority to do so. The Anti-Injunction Act provides
    that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment
    or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court
    by any person, whether or not such person is the per-
    son against whom such tax was assessed.”

       The penalty for not complying with the Affordable Care
    Act’s individual mandate first becomes enforceable in
    2014. The present challenge to the mandate thus seeks to
    restrain the penalty’s future collection. Amicus contends
    that the Internal Revenue Code treats the penalty as a
    tax, and that the Anti-Injunction Act therefore bars this
    suit.
       The text of the pertinent statutes suggests otherwise.
    The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits “for the purpose
    of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”
    §7421(a) (emphasis added). Congress, however, chose to
    describe the “[s]hared responsibility payment” imposed on
    those who forgo health insurance not as a “tax,” but as a
    “penalty.” §§5000A(b), (g)(2). There is no immediate
    reason to think that a statute applying to “any tax” would
    apply to a “penalty.”
       Congress’s decision to label this exaction a “penalty”
    rather than a “tax” is significant because the Affordable
    Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as
    “taxes.” See Thomas More, 

651 F. 3d

    
    
    , at 551. Where
    Congress uses certain language in one part of a statute
    and different language in another, it is generally pre-
    sumed that Congress acts intentionally. See Russello v.
    United States, 

[464 U.S. 16](/opinion/111043/russello-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 23 (1983).
       Amicus argues that even though Congress did not label
    the shared responsibility payment a tax, we should treat it
    as such under the Anti-Injunction Act because it functions
    like a tax. It is true that Congress cannot change whether
    an exaction is a tax or a penalty for constitutional pur-
    poses simply by describing it as one or the other. Congress
    may not, for example, expand its power under the Taxing
    Clause, or escape the Double Jeopardy Clause’s constraint
    on criminal sanctions, by labeling a severe financial pun-

       The Anti-Injunction Act and the Affordable Care Act,
    however, are creatures of Congress’s own creation. How
    they relate to each other is up to Congress, and the best
    evidence of Congress’s intent is the statutory text. We
    have thus applied the Anti-Injunction Act to statutorily
    described “taxes” even where that label was inaccurate.

     (1922) (Anti-Injunction
    Act applies to “Child Labor Tax” struck down as exceeding
    Congress’s taxing power in Drexel Furniture).
       Congress can, of course, describe something as a penalty
    but direct that it nonetheless be treated as a tax for pur-
    poses of the Anti-Injunction Act. For example, 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §6671(a) provides that “any reference in this title to ‘tax’
    imposed by this title shall be deemed also to refer to the
    penalties and liabilities provided by” subchapter 68B of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Penalties in subchapter 68B
    are thus treated as taxes under Title 26, which includes
    the Anti-Injunction Act. The individual mandate, how-
    ever, is not in subchapter 68B of the Code. Nor does any
    other provision state that references to taxes in Title 26
    shall also be “deemed” to apply to the individual mandate.
       Amicus attempts to show that Congress did render the
    Anti-Injunction Act applicable to the individual mandate,
    albeit by a more circuitous route. Section 5000A(g)(1) spec-
    ifies that the penalty for not complying with the man-
    date “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner
    as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of chapter
    68.” Assessable penalties in subchapter 68B, in turn,
    “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner as
    taxes.” §6671(a). According to amicus, by directing that
    the penalty be “assessed and collected in the same man-
    ner as taxes,” §5000A(g)(1) made the Anti-Injunction Act
    applicable to this penalty.

       The Government disagrees. It argues that §5000A(g)(1)
    does not direct courts to apply the Anti-Injunction Act,
    because §5000A(g) is a directive only to the Secretary of
    the Treasury to use the same “ ‘methodology and proce-
    dures’ ” to collect the penalty that he uses to collect taxes.
    Brief for United States 32–33 (quoting Seven-Sky, 

661 F. 3d

    
    
    , at 11).
       We think the Government has the better reading. As
    it observes, “Assessment” and “Collection” are chapters of
    the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary author-
    ity to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying
    the means by which he shall do so. See §6201 (assess-
    ment authority); §6301 (collection authority). Section
    5000A(g)(1)’s command that the penalty be “assessed and
    collected in the same manner” as taxes is best read as
    referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the
    same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty.
    That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of
    §5000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he
    may use to collect the penalty. See §5000A(g)(2)(A) (bar-
    ring criminal prosecutions); §5000A(g)(2)(B) (prohibiting
    the Secretary from using notices of lien and levies). The
    Anti-Injunction Act, by contrast, says nothing about the
    procedures to be used in assessing and collecting taxes.
       Amicus argues in the alternative that a different section
    of the Internal Revenue Code requires courts to treat the
    penalty as a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. Section
    6201(a) authorizes the Secretary to make “assessments of
    all taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions
    to the tax, and assessable penalties).” (Emphasis added.)
    Amicus contends that the penalty must be a tax, because
    it is an assessable penalty and §6201(a) says that taxes
    include assessable penalties.
       That argument has force only if §6201(a) is read in
    isolation. The Code contains many provisions treating
    taxes and assessable penalties as distinct terms. See, e.g.,
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          15
    
                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    §§860(h)(1), 6324A(a), 6601(e)(1)–(2), 6602, 7122(b). There
    would, for example, be no need for §6671(a) to deem “tax”
    to refer to certain assessable penalties if the Code al-
    ready included all such penalties in the term “tax.” In-
    deed, amicus’s earlier observation that the Code requires
    assessable penalties to be assessed and collected “in the
    same manner as taxes” makes little sense if assessable
    penalties are themselves taxes. In light of the Code’s
    consistent distinction between the terms “tax” and “as-
    sessable penalty,” we must accept the Government’s in-
    terpretation: §6201(a) instructs the Secretary that his
    authority to assess taxes includes the authority to assess
    penalties, but it does not equate assessable penalties to
    taxes for other purposes.
      The Affordable Care Act does not require that the pen-
    alty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be
    treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.
    The Anti-Injunction Act therefore does not apply to this
    suit, and we may proceed to the merits.
                                  III
       The Government advances two theories for the proposi-
    tion that Congress had constitutional authority to enact
    the individual mandate. First, the Government argues
    that Congress had the power to enact the mandate under
    the Commerce Clause. Under that theory, Congress may
    order individuals to buy health insurance because the
    failure to do so affects interstate commerce, and could un-
    dercut the Affordable Care Act’s other reforms. Second,
    the Government argues that if the commerce power does
    not support the mandate, we should nonetheless uphold it
    as an exercise of Congress’s power to tax. According to the
    Government, even if Congress lacks the power to direct
    individuals to buy insurance, the only effect of the indi-
    vidual mandate is to raise taxes on those who do not do so,
    and thus the law may be upheld as a tax.
    16       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
                                  A
      The Government’s first argument is that the individual
    mandate is a valid exercise of Congress’s power under the
    Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause.
    According to the Government, the health care market is
    characterized by a significant cost-shifting problem. Every-
    one will eventually need health care at a time and to an
    extent they cannot predict, but if they do not have insur-
    ance, they often will not be able to pay for it. Because
    state and federal laws nonetheless require hospitals to
    provide a certain degree of care to individuals without
    regard to their ability to pay, see, e.g., 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1395dd;
    Fla. Stat. Ann. §395.1041, hospitals end up receiving
    compensation for only a portion of the services they pro-
    vide. To recoup the losses, hospitals pass on the cost to
    insurers through higher rates, and insurers, in turn, pass
    on the cost to policy holders in the form of higher pre-
    miums. Congress estimated that the cost of uncompen-
    sated care raises family health insurance premiums, on
    average, by over $1,000 per year. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(F).
      In the Affordable Care Act, Congress addressed the
    problem of those who cannot obtain insurance coverage
    because of preexisting conditions or other health issues. It
    did so through the Act’s “guaranteed-issue” and “community-
    rating” provisions. These provisions together prohibit in-
    surance companies from denying coverage to those with
    such conditions or charging unhealthy individuals higher
    premiums than healthy individuals. See §§300gg, 300gg–1,
    300gg–3, 300gg–4.
      The guaranteed-issue and community-rating reforms do
    not, however, address the issue of healthy individuals who
    choose not to purchase insurance to cover potential health
    care needs. In fact, the reforms sharply exacerbate that
    problem, by providing an incentive for individuals to delay
    purchasing health insurance until they become sick, rely-
    ing on the promise of guaranteed and affordable coverage.

                        Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    The reforms also threaten to impose massive new costs on
    insurers, who are required to accept unhealthy individuals
    but prohibited from charging them rates necessary to pay
    for their coverage. This will lead insurers to significantly
    increase premiums on everyone. See Brief for America’s
    Health Insurance Plans et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–
    393 etc. 8–9.
      The individual mandate was Congress’s solution to
    these problems. By requiring that individuals purchase
    health insurance, the mandate prevents cost-shifting by
    those who would otherwise go without it. In addition, the
    mandate forces into the insurance risk pool more healthy
    individuals, whose premiums on average will be higher
    than their health care expenses. This allows insurers to
    subsidize the costs of covering the unhealthy individuals
    the reforms require them to accept. The Government
    claims that Congress has power under the Commerce and
    Necessary and Proper Clauses to enact this solution.
                                   1
       The Government contends that the individual mandate
    is within Congress’s power because the failure to pur-
    chase insurance “has a substantial and deleterious effect
    on interstate commerce” by creating the cost-shifting prob-
    lem. Brief for United States 34. The path of our Com-
    merce Clause decisions has not always run smooth, see
    United States v. Lopez, 

[514 U.S. 549](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    , 552–559 (1995), but
    it is now well established that Congress has broad author-
    ity under the Clause. We have recognized, for example,
    that “[t]he power of Congress over interstate commerce is
    not confined to the regulation of commerce among the
    states,” but extends to activities that “have a substantial
    effect on interstate commerce.” United States v. Darby,
    

[312 U.S. 100](/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/)

    
    
    , 118–119 (1941). Congress’s power, more-
    over, is not limited to regulation of an activity that by itself
    substantially affects interstate commerce, but also extends

    to activities that do so only when aggregated with similar
    activities of others. See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–128.
       Given its expansive scope, it is no surprise that Con-
    gress has employed the commerce power in a wide variety
    of ways to address the pressing needs of the time. But
    Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to
    compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase
    an unwanted product.3 Legislative novelty is not nec-
    essarily fatal; there is a first time for everything. But
    sometimes “the most telling indication of [a] severe con-
    stitutional problem . . . is the lack of historical precedent”
    for Congress’s action. Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Com-

    very least, we should “pause to consider the implications of
    the Government’s arguments” when confronted with such
    new conceptions of federal power. Lopez, supra, at 564.
       The Constitution grants Congress the power to “regulate
    Commerce.” Art. I, §8, cl. 3 (emphasis added). The power
    to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of com-
    mercial activity to be regulated. If the power to “regulate”
    something included the power to create it, many of the
    provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous. For
    example, the Constitution gives Congress the power to
    “coin Money,” in addition to the power to “regulate the
    Value thereof.” Id., cl. 5. And it gives Congress the power

    of those mandates—to report for jury duty, to register for the draft, to
    purchase firearms in anticipation of militia service, to exchange gold
    currency for paper currency, and to file a tax return—are based on
    constitutional provisions other than the Commerce Clause. See Art. I,
    §8, cl. 9 (to “constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court”); id.,
    cl. 12 (to “raise and support Armies”); id., cl. 16 (to “provide for organiz-
    ing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia”); id., cl. 5 (to “coin Money”);
    id., cl. 1 (to “lay and collect Taxes”).

    to “raise and support Armies” and to “provide and main-
    tain a Navy,” in addition to the power to “make Rules
    for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval
    Forces.” Id., cls. 12–14. If the power to regulate the
    armed forces or the value of money included the power to
    bring the subject of the regulation into existence, the
    specific grant of such powers would have been unneces-
    sary. The language of the Constitution reflects the natu-
    ral understanding that the power to regulate assumes
    there is already something to be regulated. See Gibbons, 9
    Wheat., at 188 (“[T]he enlightened patriots who framed
    our constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be
    understood to have employed words in their natural sense,
    and to have intended what they have said”).4
      Our precedent also reflects this understanding. As
    expansive as our cases construing the scope of the com-
    merce power have been, they all have one thing in com-
    mon: They uniformly describe the power as reaching
    “activity.” It is nearly impossible to avoid the word when
    quoting them. See, e.g., Lopez, supra, at 560 (“Where

    this conclusion, the case cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG relied on a diction-

    unlikely that the Framers had such an obscure meaning in mind when

    meant “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” which presupposes something to

       The individual mandate, however, does not regulate
    existing commercial activity. It instead compels individ-
    uals to become active in commerce by purchasing a product,

    commerce. Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Con-
    gress to regulate individuals precisely because they are

    decide not to do something; in others they simply fail to
    do it. Allowing Congress to justify federal regulation by
    pointing to the effect of inaction on commerce would bring
    countless decisions an individual could potentially make
    within the scope of federal regulation, and—under the
    Government’s theory—empower Congress to make those
    decisions for him.
       Applying the Government’s logic to the familiar case of
    Wickard v. Filburn shows how far that logic would carry
    us from the notion of a government of limited powers. In
    Wickard, the Court famously upheld a federal penalty im-
    posed on a farmer for growing wheat for consumption
    on his own farm. 317 U. S., at 114–115, 128–129. That
    amount of wheat caused the farmer to exceed his quota
    under a program designed to support the price of wheat by
    limiting supply. The Court rejected the farmer’s argument
    that growing wheat for home consumption was beyond the
    reach of the commerce power. It did so on the ground that
    the farmer’s decision to grow wheat for his own use al-
    lowed him to avoid purchasing wheat in the market. That
    decision, when considered in the aggregate along with sim-
    ilar decisions of others, would have had a substantial ef-
    fect on the interstate market for wheat. Id., at 127–129.
       Wickard has long been regarded as “perhaps the most
    far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over
    intrastate activity,” Lopez, 514 U. S., at 560, but the Gov-
    ernment’s theory in this case would go much further.
    Under Wickard it is within Congress’s power to regulate
    the market for wheat by supporting its price. But price
    can be supported by increasing demand as well as by
    decreasing supply. The aggregated decisions of some
    consumers not to purchase wheat have a substantial effect
    on the price of wheat, just as decisions not to purchase
    health insurance have on the price of insurance. Congress
    can therefore command that those not buying wheat do so,
    just as it argues here that it may command that those not

    buying health insurance do so. The farmer in Wickard
    was at least actively engaged in the production of wheat,
    and the Government could regulate that activity because
    of its effect on commerce. The Government’s theory here
    would effectively override that limitation, by establishing
    that individuals may be regulated under the Commerce
    Clause whenever enough of them are not doing something
    the Government would have them do.
       Indeed, the Government’s logic would justify a manda-
    tory purchase to solve almost any problem. See Seven-Sky,
    

661 F. 3d

    
    
    , at 14–15 (noting the Government’s inability
    to “identify any mandate to purchase a product or ser-
    vice in interstate commerce that would be unconstitu-
    tional” under its theory of the commerce power). To
    consider a different example in the health care market, many
    Americans do not eat a balanced diet. That group makes
    up a larger percentage of the total population than those
    without health insurance. See, e.g., Dept. of Agriculture
    and Dept. of Health and Human Services, Dietary Guide-
    lines for Americans 1 (2010). The failure of that group
    to have a healthy diet increases health care costs, to a
    greater extent than the failure of the uninsured to pur-
    chase insurance. See, e.g., Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, &
    Dietz, Annual Medical Spending Attributable to Obesity:
    Payer- and Service-Specific Estimates, 28 Health Affairs
    w822 (2009) (detailing the “undeniable link between ris-
    ing rates of obesity and rising medical spending,” and esti-
    mating that “the annual medical burden of obesity has
    risen to almost 10 percent of all medical spending and
    could amount to $147 billion per year in 2008”). Those in-
    creased costs are borne in part by other Americans who
    must pay more, just as the uninsured shift costs to the
    insured. See Center for Applied Ethics, Voluntary Health
    Risks: Who Should Pay?, 6 Issues in Ethics 6 (1993) (not-
    ing “overwhelming evidence that individuals with un-
    healthy habits pay only a fraction of the costs associated

    with their behaviors; most of the expense is borne by the
    rest of society in the form of higher insurance premiums,
    government expenditures for health care, and disability
    benefits”). Congress addressed the insurance problem by
    ordering everyone to buy insurance. Under the Gov-
    ernment’s theory, Congress could address the diet problem
    by ordering everyone to buy vegetables. See Dietary
    Guidelines, supra, at 19 (“Improved nutrition, appropriate
    eating behaviors, and increased physical activity have tre-
    mendous potential to . . . reduce health care costs”).
       People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things
    that would be good for them or good for society. Those
    failures—joined with the similar failures of others—can
    readily have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.
    Under the Government’s logic, that authorizes Congress to
    use its commerce power to compel citizens to act as the
    Government would have them act.
       That is not the country the Framers of our Constitution
    envisioned. James Madison explained that the Commerce
    Clause was “an addition which few oppose and from which
    no apprehensions are entertained.” The Federalist No. 45,
    at 293. While Congress’s authority under the Commerce
    Clause has of course expanded with the growth of the
    national economy, our cases have “always recognized that
    the power to regulate commerce, though broad indeed, has
    limits.” Maryland v. Wirtz, 

[392 U.S. 183](/opinion/107734/maryland-v-wirtz/)

    
    
    , 196 (1968). The
    Government’s theory would erode those limits, permitting
    Congress to reach beyond the natural extent of its author-
    ity, “everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and
    drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.” The Feder-
    alist No. 48, at 309 (J. Madison). Congress already enjoys
    vast power to regulate much of what we do. Accepting
    the Government’s theory would give Congress the same
    license to regulate what we do not do, fundamentally
    changing the relation between the citizen and the Federal

    Government.6
       To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between
    activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic
    effects on commerce. But the distinction between doing
    something and doing nothing would not have been lost on
    the Framers, who were “practical statesmen,” not meta-
    physical philosophers. Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO

    , 673 (1980)
    (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment). As we have ex-
    plained, “the framers of the Constitution were not mere
    visionaries, toying with speculations or theories, but
    practical men, dealing with the facts of political life as
    they understood them, putting into form the government
    they were creating, and prescribing in language clear
    and intelligible the powers that government was to take.”

    The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate com-
    merce, not to compel it, and for over 200 years both our
    decisions and Congress’s actions have reflected this un-
    derstanding. There is no reason to depart from that un-
    derstanding now.
       The Government sees things differently. It argues that
    because sickness and injury are unpredictable but una-
    voidable, “the uninsured as a class are active in the mar-
    ket for health care, which they regularly seek and obtain.”

      6 In an attempt to recast the individual mandate as a regulation of
    
    commercial activity, JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that “[a]n individual
    who opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can be seen
    as actively selecting another form of insurance: self-insurance.” Post, at
    26. But “self-insurance” is, in this context, nothing more than a de-
    scription of the failure to purchase insurance. Individuals are no more
    “activ[e] in the self-insurance market” when they fail to purchase
    insurance, ibid., than they are active in the “rest” market when doing
    nothing.

    active participation—requiring that they do so through
    insurance, rather than through attempted self-insurance
    with the back-stop of shifting costs to others.” Ibid.
       The Government repeats the phrase “active in the mar-
    ket for health care” throughout its brief, see id., at 7, 18,
    34, 50, but that concept has no constitutional significance.
    An individual who bought a car two years ago and may
    buy another in the future is not “active in the car market”
    in any pertinent sense. The phrase “active in the market”
    cannot obscure the fact that most of those regulated by
    the individual mandate are not currently engaged in any
    commercial activity involving health care, and that fact is
    fatal to the Government’s effort to “regulate the uninsured
    as a class.” Id., at 42. Our precedents recognize Con-
    gress’s power to regulate “class[es] of activities,” Gonzales
    v. Raich, 

[545 U.S. 1](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    , 17 (2005) (emphasis added), not
    classes of individuals, apart from any activity in which
    they are engaged, see, e.g., Perez, 402 U. S., at 153 (“Peti-
    tioner is clearly a member of the class which engages in
    ‘extortionate credit transactions’ . . .” (emphasis deleted)).
       The individual mandate’s regulation of the uninsured as
    a class is, in fact, particularly divorced from any link to
    existing commercial activity. The mandate primarily
    affects healthy, often young adults who are less likely to
    need significant health care and have other priorities for
    spending their money. It is precisely because these indi-
    viduals, as an actuarial class, incur relatively low health
    care costs that the mandate helps counter the effect of
    forcing insurance companies to cover others who impose
    greater costs than their premiums are allowed to reflect.
    See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(I) (recognizing that the mandate
    would “broaden the health insurance risk pool to include
    healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance
    premiums”). If the individual mandate is targeted at a
    class, it is a class whose commercial inactivity rather than
    activity is its defining feature.

                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
       The Government, however, claims that this does not
    matter. The Government regards it as sufficient to trigger
    Congress’s authority that almost all those who are unin-
    sured will, at some unknown point in the future, engage
    in a health care transaction. Asserting that “[t]here is no
    temporal limitation in the Commerce Clause,” the Gov-
    ernment argues that because “[e]veryone subject to this
    regulation is in or will be in the health care market,” they
    can be “regulated in advance.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 109 (Mar.
    27, 2012).
       The proposition that Congress may dictate the conduct
    of an individual today because of prophesied future ac-
    tivity finds no support in our precedent. We have said that
    Congress can anticipate the effects on commerce of an eco-
    nomic activity. See, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB,
    

[305 U.S. 197](/opinion/103099/consolidated-edison-co-v-nlrb/)

    
    
     (1938) (regulating the labor practices of
    utility companies); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United
    States,

     (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by
    hotel operators); Katzenbach v. McClung, 

[379 U.S. 294](/opinion/106951/katzenbach-v-mcclung/)

    
    
    (1964) (prohibiting discrimination by restaurant owners).
    But we have never permitted Congress to anticipate that
    activity itself in order to regulate individuals not currently
    engaged in commerce. Each one of our cases, including
    those cited by JUSTICE GINSBURG, post, at 20–21, involved
    preexisting economic activity. See, e.g., Wickard, 317
    U. S., at 127–129 (producing wheat); Raich, supra, at 25
    (growing marijuana).
       Everyone will likely participate in the markets for food,
    clothing, transportation, shelter, or energy; that does not
    authorize Congress to direct them to purchase particular
    products in those or other markets today. The Commerce
    Clause is not a general license to regulate an individual
    from cradle to grave, simply because he will predictably
    engage in particular transactions. Any police power to
    regulate individuals as such, as opposed to their activities,
    remains vested in the States.

                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
       The Government argues that the individual mandate
    can be sustained as a sort of exception to this rule, because
    health insurance is a unique product. According to the
    Government, upholding the individual mandate would
    not justify mandatory purchases of items such as cars or
    broccoli because, as the Government puts it, “[h]ealth in-
    surance is not purchased for its own sake like a car or
    broccoli; it is a means of financing health-care consump-
    tion and covering universal risks.” Reply Brief for United
    States 19. But cars and broccoli are no more purchased
    for their “own sake” than health insurance. They are
    purchased to cover the need for transportation and food.
       The Government says that health insurance and health
    care financing are “inherently integrated.” Brief for United
    States 41. But that does not mean the compelled purchase
    of the first is properly regarded as a regulation of the
    second. No matter how “inherently integrated” health
    insurance and health care consumption may be, they are
    not the same thing: They involve different transactions,
    entered into at different times, with different providers.
    And for most of those targeted by the mandate, significant
    health care needs will be years, or even decades, away.
    The proximity and degree of connection between the
    mandate and the subsequent commercial activity is too lack-
    ing to justify an exception of the sort urged by the Gov-
    ernment.      The individual mandate forces individuals
    into commerce precisely because they elected to refrain
    from commercial activity. Such a law cannot be sus-
    tained under a clause authorizing Congress to “regulate
    Commerce.”
                               2
      The Government next contends that Congress has the
    power under the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact the
    individual mandate because the mandate is an “integral
    part of a comprehensive scheme of economic regulation”—
    28       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    the guaranteed-issue and community-rating insurance
    reforms. Brief for United States 24. Under this argu-
    ment, it is not necessary to consider the effect that an
    individual’s inactivity may have on interstate commerce; it
    is enough that Congress regulate commercial activity in a
    way that requires regulation of inactivity to be effective.
       The power to “make all Laws which shall be necessary
    and proper for carrying into Execution” the powers enu-
    merated in the Constitution, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, vests Con-
    gress with authority to enact provisions “incidental to the
    [enumerated] power, and conducive to its beneficial exer-
    cise,” McCulloch, 4 Wheat., at 418. Although the Clause
    gives Congress authority to “legislate on that vast mass
    of incidental powers which must be involved in the con-
    stitution,” it does not license the exercise of any “great
    substantive and independent power[s]” beyond those specifi-
    cally enumerated. Id., at 411, 421. Instead, the Clause is
    “ ‘merely a declaration, for the removal of all uncertainty,
    that the means of carrying into execution those [powers]
    otherwise granted are included in the grant.’ ” Kinsella v.
    United States ex rel. Singleton,

    (quoting VI Writings of James Madison 383 (G. Hunt ed.
    1906)).
       As our jurisprudence under the Necessary and Proper
    Clause has developed, we have been very deferential to
    Congress’s determination that a regulation is “necessary.”
    We have thus upheld laws that are “ ‘convenient, or use-
    ful’ or ‘conducive’ to the authority’s ‘beneficial exercise.’ ”

    responsibility to declare unconstitutional those laws that
    undermine the structure of government established by the
    Constitution. Such laws, which are not “consist[ent] with
    the letter and spirit of the constitution,” McCulloch, supra,
    at 421, are not “proper [means] for carrying into Execu-
    tion” Congress’s enumerated powers. Rather, they are, “in

    tial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the

       Applying these principles, the individual mandate can-
    not be sustained under the Necessary and Proper Clause
    as an essential component of the insurance reforms. Each
    of our prior cases upholding laws under that Clause in-
    volved exercises of authority derivative of, and in service
    to, a granted power. For example, we have upheld provi-
    sions permitting continued confinement of those already
    in federal custody when they could not be safely released,

    ing bribes involving organizations receiving federal funds,

    , 459, 462 (2003). The individual mandate, by con-
    trast, vests Congress with the extraordinary ability to
    create the necessary predicate to the exercise of an enu-
    merated power.
       This is in no way an authority that is “narrow in scope,”
    Comstock, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20), or “incidental” to
    the exercise of the commerce power, McCulloch, supra, at
    418. Rather, such a conception of the Necessary and
    Proper Clause would work a substantial expansion of
    federal authority. No longer would Congress be limited to
    regulating under the Commerce Clause those who by some
    preexisting activity bring themselves within the sphere of
    federal regulation. Instead, Congress could reach beyond
    30       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS

    the natural limit of its authority and draw within its
    regulatory scope those who otherwise would be outside of
    it. Even if the individual mandate is “necessary” to the
    Act’s insurance reforms, such an expansion of federal
    power is not a “proper” means for making those reforms
    effective.
       The Government relies primarily on our decision in
    Gonzales v. Raich. In Raich, we considered “comprehen-
    sive legislation to regulate the interstate market” in mari-
    juana. 545 U. S., at 22. Certain individuals sought an
    exemption from that regulation on the ground that they
    engaged in only intrastate possession and consumption.
    We denied any exemption, on the ground that marijuana
    is a fungible commodity, so that any marijuana could
    be readily diverted into the interstate market. Congress’s
    attempt to regulate the interstate market for marijuana
    would therefore have been substantially undercut if it
    could not also regulate intrastate possession and con-
    sumption. Id., at 19. Accordingly, we recognized that
    “Congress was acting well within its authority” under the
    Necessary and Proper Clause even though its “regulation
    ensnare[d] some purely intrastate activity.” Id., at 22; see
    also Perez, 402 U. S., at 154. Raich thus did not involve
    the exercise of any “great substantive and independent
    power,” McCulloch, supra, at 411, of the sort at issue here.
    Instead, it concerned only the constitutionality of “indi-
    vidual applications of a concededly valid statutory
    scheme.” Raich, supra, at 23 (emphasis added).
       Just as the individual mandate cannot be sustained as
    a law regulating the substantial effects of the failure to
    purchase health insurance, neither can it be upheld as
    a “necessary and proper” component of the insurance re-
    forms. The commerce power thus does not authorize the
    mandate. Accord, post, at 4–16 (joint opinion of SCALIA,
    KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).

                                  B
       That is not the end of the matter. Because the Com-
    merce Clause does not support the individual mandate, it
    is necessary to turn to the Government’s second argument:
    that the mandate may be upheld as within Congress’s
    enumerated power to “lay and collect Taxes.” Art. I, §8,
    cl. 1.
       The Government’s tax power argument asks us to view
    the statute differently than we did in considering its com-
    merce power theory. In making its Commerce Clause
    argument, the Government defended the mandate as a
    regulation requiring individuals to purchase health in-
    surance. The Government does not claim that the taxing
    power allows Congress to issue such a command. Instead,
    the Government asks us to read the mandate not as order-
    ing individuals to buy insurance, but rather as imposing a
    tax on those who do not buy that product.
       The text of a statute can sometimes have more than one
    possible meaning. To take a familiar example, a law that
    reads “no vehicles in the park” might, or might not, ban
    bicycles in the park. And it is well established that if
    a statute has two possible meanings, one of which violates
    the Constitution, courts should adopt the meaning that
    does not do so. Justice Story said that 180 years ago: “No
    court ought, unless the terms of an act rendered it una-
    voidable, to give a construction to it which should involve
    a violation, however unintentional, of the constitution.”

    , 448–449 (1830). Justice
    Holmes made the same point a century later: “[T]he rule is
    settled that as between two possible interpretations of a
    statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and
    by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which
    will save the Act.” Blodgett v. Holden,

       The most straightforward reading of the mandate is
    that it commands individuals to purchase insurance.

    After all, it states that individuals “shall” maintain health
    insurance. 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(a). Congress thought it
    could enact such a command under the Commerce Clause,
    and the Government primarily defended the law on that
    basis. But, for the reasons explained above, the Com-
    merce Clause does not give Congress that power. Under
    our precedent, it is therefore necessary to ask whether the
    Government’s alternative reading of the statute—that it
    only imposes a tax on those without insurance—is a rea-
    sonable one.
       Under the mandate, if an individual does not maintain
    health insurance, the only consequence is that he must
    make an additional payment to the IRS when he pays his
    taxes. See §5000A(b). That, according to the Government,
    means the mandate can be regarded as establishing a
    condition—not owning health insurance—that triggers a
    tax—the required payment to the IRS. Under that theory,
    the mandate is not a legal command to buy insurance.
    Rather, it makes going without insurance just another
    thing the Government taxes, like buying gasoline or earn-
    ing income. And if the mandate is in effect just a tax hike
    on certain taxpayers who do not have health insurance, it
    may be within Congress’s constitutional power to tax.
       The question is not whether that is the most natural
    interpretation of the mandate, but only whether it is a
    “fairly possible” one. Crowell v. Benson, 

[285 U.S. 22](/opinion/101864/crowell-v-benson/)

    tion must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from
    unconstitutionality.” Hooper v. California,

    mandate as imposing a tax, if it would otherwise violate
    the Constitution. Granting the Act the full measure of
    deference owed to federal statutes, it can be so read, for
    the reasons set forth below.

       The exaction the Affordable Care Act imposes on those
    without health insurance looks like a tax in many re-
    spects. The “[s]hared responsibility payment,” as the
    statute entitles it, is paid into the Treasury by “tax-
    payer[s]” when they file their tax returns.

    §5000A(b). It does not apply to individuals who do not
    pay federal income taxes because their household income
    is less than the filing threshold in the Internal Revenue
    Code. §5000A(e)(2). For taxpayers who do owe the pay-
    ment, its amount is determined by such familiar factors as
    taxable income, number of dependents, and joint filing
    status. §§5000A(b)(3), (c)(2), (c)(4). The requirement to
    pay is found in the Internal Revenue Code and enforced by
    the IRS, which—as we previously explained—must assess
    and collect it “in the same manner as taxes.” Supra, at
    13–14. This process yields the essential feature of any tax:
    it produces at least some revenue for the Government.

    Indeed, the payment is expected to raise about $4 billion
    per year by 2017. Congressional Budget Office, Payments
    of Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Pro-
    tection and Affordable Care Act (Apr. 30, 2010), in Selected

       It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as
    a “penalty,” not a “tax.” But while that label is fatal to the
    application of the Anti-Injunction Act, supra, at 12–13, it
    does not determine whether the payment may be viewed
    as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. It is up to Con-
    gress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any
    particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Con-
    gress’s choice of label on that question. That choice does
    not, however, control whether an exaction is within Con-
    gress’s constitutional power to tax.
       Our precedent reflects this: In 1922, we decided two

    challenges to the “Child Labor Tax” on the same day. In
    the first, we held that a suit to enjoin collection of the so-
    called tax was barred by the Anti-Injunction Act. George,
    259 U. S., at 20. Congress knew that suits to obstruct
    taxes had to await payment under the Anti-Injunction
    Act; Congress called the child labor tax a tax; Congress
    therefore intended the Anti-Injunction Act to apply. In
    the second case, however, we held that the same exaction,
    although labeled a tax, was not in fact authorized by Con-
    gress’s taxing power. Drexel Furniture, 259 U. S., at 38.
    That constitutional question was not controlled by Con-
    gress’s choice of label.
       We have similarly held that exactions not labeled taxes
    nonetheless were authorized by Congress’s power to tax.
    In the License Tax Cases, for example, we held that federal
    licenses to sell liquor and lottery tickets—for which the
    licensee had to pay a fee—could be sustained as exercises
    of the taxing power. 5 Wall., at 471. And in New York v.
    United States we upheld as a tax a “surcharge” on out-of-
    state nuclear waste shipments, a portion of which was
    paid to the Federal Treasury. 505 U. S., at 171. We thus
    ask whether the shared responsibility payment falls
    within Congress’s taxing power, “[d]isregarding the designa-
    tion of the exaction, and viewing its substance and appli-
    cation.” United States v. Constantine,

        Our cases confirm this functional approach. For ex-
    ample, in Drexel Furniture, we focused on three practical
    characteristics of the so-called tax on employing child
    laborers that convinced us the “tax” was actually a pen-
    alty. First, the tax imposed an exceedingly heavy bur-
    den—10 percent of a company’s net income—on those who
    employed children, no matter how small their infraction.
    Second, it imposed that exaction only on those who know-
    ingly employed underage laborers. Such scienter require-
    ments are typical of punitive statutes, because Congress
    often wishes to punish only those who intentionally break
    the law. Third, this “tax” was enforced in part by the
    Department of Labor, an agency responsible for pun-
    ishing violations of labor laws, not collecting revenue. 259
    U. S., at 36–37; see also, e.g., Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at
    780–782 (considering, inter alia, the amount of the exac-
    tion, and the fact that it was imposed for violation of a
    separate criminal law); Constantine, supra, at 295 (same).
        The same analysis here suggests that the shared re-
    sponsibility payment may for constitutional purposes be
    considered a tax, not a penalty: First, for most Americans
    the amount due will be far less than the price of insur-
    ance, and, by statute, it can never be more.8 It may often

    attempt to distinguish Sotelo as a statutory construction case from the

    be a reasonable financial decision to make the payment
    rather than purchase insurance, unlike the “prohibitory”
    financial punishment in Drexel Furniture. 259 U. S., at
    37. Second, the individual mandate contains no scienter
    requirement. Third, the payment is collected solely by the
    IRS through the normal means of taxation—except that
    the Service is not allowed to use those means most sugges-
    tive of a punitive sanction, such as criminal prosecution.
    See §5000A(g)(2). The reasons the Court in Drexel Furni-
    ture held that what was called a “tax” there was a penalty
    support the conclusion that what is called a “penalty” here
    may be viewed as a tax.9
       None of this is to say that the payment is not intended
    to affect individual conduct. Although the payment will
    raise considerable revenue, it is plainly designed to ex-
    pand health insurance coverage. But taxes that seek to
    influence conduct are nothing new. Some of our earliest
    federal taxes sought to deter the purchase of imported
    manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of do-
    mestic industry. See W. Brownlee, Federal Taxation in
    America 22 (2d ed. 2004); cf. 2 J. Story, Commentaries on
    the Constitution of the United States §962, p. 434 (1833)

    purposes, than revenue”). Today, federal and state taxes

       9 We do not suggest that any exaction lacking a scienter requirement
    
    and enforced by the IRS is within the taxing power. See post, at 23–24
    (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting).
    Congress could not, for example, expand its authority to impose crimi-
    nal fines by creating strict liability offenses enforced by the IRS rather
    than the FBI. But the fact the exaction here is paid like a tax, to the
    agency that collects taxes—rather than, for example, exacted by De-
    partment of Labor inspectors after ferreting out willful malfeasance—
    suggests that this exaction may be viewed as a tax.

    explained that “if the concept of penalty means anything,
    it means punishment for an unlawful act or omission.”

    word is here used, is an exaction imposed by statute as

    mandate clearly aims to induce the purchase of health
    insurance, it need not be read to declare that failing to do
    so is unlawful. Neither the Act nor any other law attaches
    negative legal consequences to not buying health insur-
    ance, beyond requiring a payment to the IRS. The Gov-

    tolerable suggests that Congress did not think it was
    creating four million outlaws. It suggests instead that the
    shared responsibility payment merely imposes a tax citi-
    zens may lawfully choose to pay in lieu of buying health
    insurance.
       The plaintiffs contend that Congress’s choice of lan-
    guage—stating that individuals “shall” obtain insurance
    or pay a “penalty”—requires reading §5000A as punishing
    unlawful conduct, even if that interpretation would ren-
    der the law unconstitutional. We have rejected a similar
    argument before. In New York v. United States we exam-
    ined a statute providing that “ ‘[e]ach State shall be re-
    sponsible for providing . . . for the disposal of . . . low-level
    radioactive waste.’ ” 505 U. S., at 169 (quoting 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §2021c(a)(1)(A)). A State that shipped its waste to another
    State was exposed to surcharges by the receiving State,
    a portion of which would be paid over to the Federal
    Government.       And a State that did not adhere to the
    statutory scheme faced “[p]enalties for failure to comply,”
    including increases in the surcharge. §2021e(e)(2); New
    York, 505 U. S., at 152–153. New York urged us to read
    the statute as a federal command that the state legisla-
    ture enact legislation to dispose of its waste, which would
    have violated the Constitution. To avoid that outcome, we
    interpreted the statute to impose only “a series of incen-
    tives” for the State to take responsibility for its waste. We
    then sustained the charge paid to the Federal Government
    as an exercise of the taxing power. Id., at 169–174. We
    see no insurmountable obstacle to a similar approach

       The joint dissenters argue that we cannot uphold
    §5000A as a tax because Congress did not “frame” it as
    such. Post, at 17. In effect, they contend that even if
    the Constitution permits Congress to do exactly what we
    interpret this statute to do, the law must be struck down
    because Congress used the wrong labels. An example may
    help illustrate why labels should not control here. Sup-
    pose Congress enacted a statute providing that every
    taxpayer who owns a house without energy efficient win-
    dows must pay $50 to the IRS. The amount due is adjusted
    based on factors such as taxable income and joint filing
    status, and is paid along with the taxpayer’s income tax
    return. Those whose income is below the filing threshold
    need not pay. The required payment is not called a “tax,”
    a “penalty,” or anything else. No one would doubt that
    this law imposed a tax, and was within Congress’s power
    to tax. That conclusion should not change simply because
    Congress used the word “penalty” to describe the pay-
    ment. Interpreting such a law to be a tax would hardly
    “[i]mpos[e] a tax through judicial legislation.” Post, at 25.
    Rather, it would give practical effect to the Legislature’s
    enactment.
       Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the
    power to impose the exaction in §5000A under the taxing
    power, and that §5000A need not be read to do more than
    impose a tax. That is sufficient to sustain it. The “ques-
    tion of the constitutionality of action taken by Congress
    does not depend on recitals of the power which it under-
    takes to exercise.” Woods v. Cloyd W. Miller Co., 333 U. S.

       Even if the taxing power enables Congress to impose
    a tax on not obtaining health insurance, any tax must
    still comply with other requirements in the Constitution.
    Plaintiffs argue that the shared responsibility payment
    does not do so, citing Article I, §9, clause 4. That clause
    provides: “No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid,
    unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein
    before directed to be taken.” This requirement means that
    any “direct Tax” must be apportioned so that each State
    pays in proportion to its population. According to the
    plaintiffs, if the individual mandate imposes a tax, it is a
    direct tax, and it is unconstitutional because Congress
    made no effort to apportion it among the States.
       Even when the Direct Tax Clause was written it was
    unclear what else, other than a capitation (also known as
    a “head tax” or a “poll tax”), might be a direct tax. See
    Springer v. United States, 

[102 U.S. 586](/opinion/90272/springer-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 596–598 (1881).
    Soon after the framing, Congress passed a tax on owner-
    ship of carriages, over James Madison’s objection that it
    was an unapportioned direct tax. Id., at 597. This Court
    upheld the tax, in part reasoning that apportioning such
    a tax would make little sense, because it would have re-
    quired taxing carriage owners at dramatically different
    rates depending on how many carriages were in their
    home State. See Hylton v. United States, 3 Dall. 171, 174
    (1796) (opinion of Chase, J.). The Court was unanimous,
    and those Justices who wrote opinions either directly
    asserted or strongly suggested that only two forms of
    taxation were direct: capitations and land taxes. See id.,
    at 175; id., at 177 (opinion of Paterson, J.); id., at 183
    (opinion of Iredell, J.).
       That narrow view of what a direct tax might be per-
    sisted for a century. In 1880, for example, we explained that
    “direct taxes, within the meaning of the Constitution, are
    only capitation taxes, as expressed in that instrument,

      A tax on going without health insurance does not fall
    within any recognized category of direct tax. It is not a
    capitation. Capitations are taxes paid by every person,
    “without regard to property, profession, or any other cir-
    cumstance.” Hylton, supra, at 175 (opinion of Chase, J.)
    (emphasis altered). The whole point of the shared respon-
    sibility payment is that it is triggered by specific cir-
    cumstances—earning a certain amount of income but not
    obtaining health insurance. The payment is also plainly
    not a tax on the ownership of land or personal property.
    The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax
    that must be apportioned among the several States.
      There may, however, be a more fundamental objection
    to a tax on those who lack health insurance. Even if only
    a tax, the payment under §5000A(b) remains a burden
    that the Federal Government imposes for an omission, not
    an act. If it is troubling to interpret the Commerce Clause
    as authorizing Congress to regulate those who abstain
    from commerce, perhaps it should be similarly troubling to
    permit Congress to impose a tax for not doing something.
      Three considerations allay this concern. First, and most
    importantly, it is abundantly clear the Constitution does
    not guarantee that individuals may avoid taxation through
    inactivity. A capitation, after all, is a tax that every-
    one must pay simply for existing, and capitations are
    expressly contemplated by the Constitution. The Court
    today holds that our Constitution protects us from federal

    regulation under the Commerce Clause so long as we ab-
    stain from the regulated activity. But from its creation,
    the Constitution has made no such promise with respect to
    taxes. See Letter from Benjamin Franklin to M. Le Roy
    (Nov. 13, 1789) (“Our new Constitution is now established
    . . . but in this world nothing can be said to be certain,
    except death and taxes”).
        Whether the mandate can be upheld under the Com-
    merce Clause is a question about the scope of federal
    authority. Its answer depends on whether Congress can
    exercise what all acknowledge to be the novel course of
    directing individuals to purchase insurance. Congress’s
    use of the Taxing Clause to encourage buying something
    is, by contrast, not new. Tax incentives already promote,
    for example, purchasing homes and professional educa-
    tions. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§163(h), 25A. Sustaining the
    mandate as a tax depends only on whether Congress has
    properly exercised its taxing power to encourage purchas-
    ing health insurance, not whether it can. Upholding the
    individual mandate under the Taxing Clause thus does
    not recognize any new federal power. It determines that
    Congress has used an existing one.
        Second, Congress’s ability to use its taxing power to
    influence conduct is not without limits. A few of our cases
    policed these limits aggressively, invalidating punitive
    exactions obviously designed to regulate behavior other-
    wise regarded at the time as beyond federal authority.
    See, e.g., United States v. Butler, 

[297 U.S. 1](/opinion/102580/united-states-v-butler/)

    
    
     (1936); Drexel

    . More often and more recently
    we have declined to closely examine the regulatory motive
    or effect of revenue-raising measures. See Kahriger, 345
    U. S., at 27–31 (collecting cases). We have nonetheless
    maintained that “ ‘there comes a time in the extension of
    the penalizing features of the so-called tax when it loses
    its character as such and becomes a mere penalty with the
    characteristics of regulation and punishment.’ ” Kurth

    Ranch, 511 U. S., at 779 (quoting Drexel Furniture, supra,
    at 38).
       We have already explained that the shared responsibil-
    ity payment’s practical characteristics pass muster as a
    tax under our narrowest interpretations of the taxing
    power. Supra, at 35–36. Because the tax at hand is
    within even those strict limits, we need not here decide the
    precise point at which an exaction becomes so punitive
    that the taxing power does not authorize it. It remains
    true, however, that the “ ‘power to tax is not the power to
    destroy while this Court sits.’ ” Oklahoma Tax Comm’n v.

       Third, although the breadth of Congress’s power to tax
    is greater than its power to regulate commerce, the taxing
    power does not give Congress the same degree of control
    over individual behavior. Once we recognize that Con-
    gress may regulate a particular decision under the Com-
    merce Clause, the Federal Government can bring its full
    weight to bear. Congress may simply command individ-
    uals to do as it directs. An individual who disobeys may
    be subjected to criminal sanctions. Those sanctions can
    include not only fines and imprisonment, but all the at-
    tendant consequences of being branded a criminal: depri-
    vation of otherwise protected civil rights, such as the right
    to bear arms or vote in elections; loss of employment op-
    portunities; social stigma; and severe disabilities in other
    controversies, such as custody or immigration disputes.
       By contrast, Congress’s authority under the taxing
    power is limited to requiring an individual to pay money
    into the Federal Treasury, no more. If a tax is properly
    paid, the Government has no power to compel or punish
    individuals subject to it. We do not make light of the se-
    vere burden that taxation—especially taxation motivated
    by a regulatory purpose—can impose. But imposition

    of a tax nonetheless leaves an individual with a lawful
    choice to do or not do a certain act, so long as he is willing
    to pay a tax levied on that choice.11
      The Affordable Care Act’s requirement that certain in-
    dividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health
    insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Be-
    cause the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role
    to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness.
                                   D
      JUSTICE GINSBURG questions the necessity of rejecting
    the Government’s commerce power argument, given that
    §5000A can be upheld under the taxing power. Post, at 37.
    But the statute reads more naturally as a command to buy
    insurance than as a tax, and I would uphold it as a com-
    mand if the Constitution allowed it. It is only because the
    Commerce Clause does not authorize such a command
    that it is necessary to reach the taxing power question.
    And it is only because we have a duty to construe a stat-
    ute to save it, if fairly possible, that §5000A can be inter-
    preted as a tax. Without deciding the Commerce Clause
    question, I would find no basis to adopt such a saving
    construction.
      The Federal Government does not have the power to
    order people to buy health insurance. Section 5000A
    would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command.
    The Federal Government does have the power to impose a
    tax on those without health insurance. Section 5000A is
    ——————
       11 Of course, individuals do not have a lawful choice not to pay a tax
    
    due, and may sometimes face prosecution for failing to do so (although
    not for declining to make the shared responsibility payment, see 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(g)(2)). But that does not show that the tax restricts the
    lawful choice whether to undertake or forgo the activity on which the tax
    is predicated. Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully
    forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance
    and pay lower taxes. The only thing they may not lawfully do is not
    buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.

      The States also contend that the Medicaid expansion
    exceeds Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause.
    They claim that Congress is coercing the States to adopt
    the changes it wants by threatening to withhold all of a
    State’s Medicaid grants, unless the State accepts the new
    expanded funding and complies with the conditions that
    come with it. This, they argue, violates the basic principle
    that the “Federal Government may not compel the States
    to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.” New
    York, 505 U. S., at 188.
      There is no doubt that the Act dramatically increases
    state obligations under Medicaid. The current Medicaid
    program requires States to cover only certain discrete
    categories of needy individuals—pregnant women, chil-
    dren, needy families, the blind, the elderly, and the dis-
    abled. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396a(a)(10). There is no mandatory
    coverage for most childless adults, and the States typically
    do not offer any such coverage. The States also enjoy
    considerable flexibility with respect to the coverage levels
    for parents of needy families. §1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii). On
    average States cover only those unemployed parents who
    make less than 37 percent of the federal poverty level, and
    only those employed parents who make less than 63 per-
    cent of the poverty line. Kaiser Comm’n on Medicaid and
    the Uninsured, Performing Under Pressure 11, and fig. 11
    (2012).
      The Medicaid provisions of the Affordable Care Act, in
    contrast, require States to expand their Medicaid pro-
    grams by 2014 to cover all individuals under the age of 65
    with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty line.
    §1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The Act also establishes a new

    “[e]ssential health benefits” package, which States must
    provide to all new Medicaid recipients—a level sufficient
    to satisfy a recipient’s obligations under the individual man-
    date. §§1396a(k)(1), 1396u–7(b)(5), 18022(b). The Af-
    fordable Care Act provides that the Federal Government
    will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these newly
    eligible individuals through 2016. §1396d(y)(1). In the
    following years, the federal payment level gradually de-
    creases, to a minimum of 90 percent. Ibid. In light of
    the expansion in coverage mandated by the Act, the Federal
    Government estimates that its Medicaid spending will in-
    crease by approximately $100 billion per year, nearly 40
    percent above current levels. Statement of Douglas W.
    Elmendorf, CBO’s Analysis of the Major Health Care
    Legislation Enacted in March 2010, p. 14, Table 2 (Mar.
    30, 2011).
       The Spending Clause grants Congress the power “to pay
    the Debts and provide for the . . . general Welfare of the
    United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1. We have
    long recognized that Congress may use this power to grant
    federal funds to the States, and may condition such a
    grant upon the States’ “taking certain actions that Con-
    gress could not require them to take.” College Savings Bank,
    527 U. S., at 686. Such measures “encourage a State
    to regulate in a particular way, [and] influenc[e] a State’s
    policy choices.” New York, supra, at 166. The con-
    ditions imposed by Congress ensure that the funds are
    used by the States to “provide for the . . . general Welfare”
    in the manner Congress intended.
       At the same time, our cases have recognized limits on
    Congress’s power under the Spending Clause to secure
    state compliance with federal objectives. “We have re-
    peatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation as
    ‘much in the nature of a contract.’ ” Barnes v. Gorman,

    legitimacy of Congress’s exercise of the spending power
    “thus rests on whether the State voluntarily and knowingly
    accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ” Pennhurst, supra,
    at 17. Respecting this limitation is critical to ensuring
    that Spending Clause legislation does not undermine the
    status of the States as independent sovereigns in our fed-
    eral system. That system “rests on what might at first
    seem a counterintuitive insight, that ‘freedom is enhanced
    by the creation of two governments, not one.’ ” Bond, 564
    U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Alden v. Maine, 

[527 U.S. 706](/opinion/118318/alden-v-maine/)

    
    
    , 758 (1999)). For this reason, “the Constitution
    has never been understood to confer upon Congress the
    ability to require the States to govern according to Con-
    gress’ instructions.” New York, supra, at 162. Otherwise
    the two-government system established by the Framers
    would give way to a system that vests power in one central
    government, and individual liberty would suffer.
       That insight has led this Court to strike down fed-
    eral legislation that commandeers a State’s legislative or
    administrative apparatus for federal purposes. See, e.g.,
    Printz, 521 U. S., at 933 (striking down federal legisla-
    tion compelling state law enforcement officers to perform
    federally mandated background checks on handgun pur-
    chasers); New York, supra, at 174–175 (invalidating provi-
    sions of an Act that would compel a State to either take
    title to nuclear waste or enact particular state waste
    regulations). It has also led us to scrutinize Spending
    Clause legislation to ensure that Congress is not using
    financial inducements to exert a “power akin to undue
    influence.” Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 

[301 U.S. 548](/opinion/102843/steward-machine-co-v-davis/)

    
    
    ,
    590 (1937). Congress may use its spending power to cre-
    ate incentives for States to act in accordance with federal
    policies. But when “pressure turns into compulsion,” ibid.,
    the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.
    “[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the
    authority to require the States to regulate.” New York,
    48       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    505 U. S., at 178. That is true whether Congress directly
    commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State
    to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.
       Permitting the Federal Government to force the States
    to implement a federal program would threaten the politi-
    cal accountability key to our federal system. “[W]here the
    Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may
    be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disap-
    proval, while the federal officials who devised the regu-
    latory program may remain insulated from the electoral
    ramifications of their decision.” Id., at 169. Spending
    Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has
    a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal condi-
    tions in exchange for federal funds. In such a situation,
    state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for
    choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when
    the State has no choice, the Federal Government can
    achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in
    New York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened
    when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because
    Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it
    could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.
       We addressed such concerns in Steward Machine. That
    case involved a federal tax on employers that was abated
    if the businesses paid into a state unemployment plan that
    met certain federally specified conditions. An employer
    sued, alleging that the tax was impermissibly “driv[ing]
    the state legislatures under the whip of economic pressure
    into the enactment of unemployment compensation laws
    at the bidding of the central government.” 301 U. S., at
    587. We acknowledged the danger that the Federal Gov-
    ernment might employ its taxing power to exert a “power
    akin to undue influence” upon the States. Id., at 590. But
    we observed that Congress adopted the challenged tax and
    abatement program to channel money to the States that
    would otherwise have gone into the Federal Treasury for
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          49

    use in providing national unemployment services. Con-
    gress was willing to direct businesses to instead pay the
    money into state programs only on the condition that the
    money be used for the same purposes. Predicating tax
    abatement on a State’s adoption of a particular type of un-
    employment legislation was therefore a means to “safe-
    guard [the Federal Government’s] own treasury.” Id., at
    591. We held that “[i]n such circumstances, if in no oth-
    ers, inducement or persuasion does not go beyond the
    bounds of power.” Ibid.
       In rejecting the argument that the federal law was a
    “weapon[ ] of coercion, destroying or impairing the auton-
    omy of the states,” the Court noted that there was no
    reason to suppose that the State in that case acted other
    than through “her unfettered will.” Id., at 586, 590.
    Indeed, the State itself did “not offer a suggestion that in
    passing the unemployment law she was affected by du-
    ress.” Id., at 589.
       As our decision in Steward Machine confirms, Congress
    may attach appropriate conditions to federal taxing and
    spending programs to preserve its control over the use of
    federal funds. In the typical case we look to the States to
    defend their prerogatives by adopting “the simple expedi-
    ent of not yielding” to federal blandishments when they
    do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.

    , 482 (1923). The
    States are separate and independent sovereigns. Some-
    times they have to act like it.
       The States, however, argue that the Medicaid expansion
    is far from the typical case. They object that Congress has
    “crossed the line distinguishing encouragement from
    coercion,” New York, supra, at 175, in the way it has struc-
    tured the funding: Instead of simply refusing to grant the
    new funds to States that will not accept the new condi-
    tions, Congress has also threatened to withhold those
    States’ existing Medicaid funds. The States claim that
    50       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT
                     BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
                     Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    this threat serves no purpose other than to force unwilling
    States to sign up for the dramatic expansion in health care
    coverage effected by the Act.
       Given the nature of the threat and the programs at
    issue here, we must agree. We have upheld Congress’s
    authority to condition the receipt of funds on the States’
    complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,
    because that is the means by which Congress ensures that
    the funds are spent according to its view of the “general
    Welfare.” Conditions that do not here govern the use
    of the funds, however, cannot be justified on that ba-
    sis. When, for example, such conditions take the form of
    threats to terminate other significant independent grants,
    the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressur-
    ing the States to accept policy changes.
       In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered a challenge to a
    federal law that threatened to withhold five percent of a
    State’s federal highway funds if the State did not raise its
    drinking age to 21. The Court found that the condition
    was “directly related to one of the main purposes for which
    highway funds are expended—safe interstate travel.” 483
    U. S., at 208. At the same time, the condition was not a
    restriction on how the highway funds—set aside for spec-
    ific highway improvement and maintenance efforts—were
    to be used.
       We accordingly asked whether “the financial induce-
    ment offered by Congress” was “so coercive as to pass the
    point at which ‘pressure turns into compulsion.’ ” Id., at
    211 (quoting Steward Machine, supra, at 590). By “finan-
    cial inducement” the Court meant the threat of losing five
    percent of highway funds; no new money was offered to
    the States to raise their drinking ages. We found that the
    inducement was not impermissibly coercive, because
    Congress was offering only “relatively mild encouragement
    to the States.” Dole, 483 U. S., at 211. We observed that
    “all South Dakota would lose if she adheres to her chosen
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          51
    
                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    course as to a suitable minimum drinking age is 5%” of
    her highway funds. Ibid. In fact, the federal funds at
    stake constituted less than half of one percent of South
    Dakota’s budget at the time. See Nat. Assn. of State
    Budget Officers, The State Expenditure Report 59 (1987);
    South Dakota v. Dole, 

791 F.2d 628

    
    
    , 630 (CA8 1986). In
    consequence, “we conclude[d] that [the] encouragement
    to state action [was] a valid use of the spending power.”
    Dole, 483 U. S., at 212. Whether to accept the drinking
    age change “remain[ed] the prerogative of the States not
    merely in theory but in fact.” Id., at 211–212.
       In this case, the financial “inducement” Congress has
    chosen is much more than “relatively mild encourage-
    ment”—it is a gun to the head. Section 1396c of the Medi-
    caid Act provides that if a State’s Medicaid plan does
    not comply with the Act’s requirements, the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services may declare that “further
    payments will not be made to the State.”

    spending accounts for over 20 percent of the average
    State’s total budget, with federal funds covering 50 to 83
    percent of those costs. See Nat. Assn. of State Budget
    Officers, Fiscal Year 2010 State Expenditure Report, p. 11,

    . §1396d(b). The Federal Gov-
    ernment estimates that it will pay out approximately $3.3
    trillion between 2010 and 2019 in order to cover the costs
    of pre-expansion Medicaid. Brief for United States 10,
    n. 6. In addition, the States have developed intricate
    statutory and administrative regimes over the course of
    many decades to implement their objectives under existing
    Medicaid. It is easy to see how the Dole Court could con-
    clude that the threatened loss of less than half of one
    percent of South Dakota’s budget left that State with a

    “prerogative” to reject Congress’s desired policy, “not
    merely in theory but in fact.” 483 U. S., at 211–212. The
    threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State’s overall
    budget, in contrast, is economic dragooning that leaves the
    States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid
    expansion.12
      JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that Dole is distinguishable
    because here “Congress has not threatened to withhold
    funds earmarked for any other program.” Post, at 47. But
    that begs the question: The States contend that the ex-
    pansion is in reality a new program and that Congress is
    forcing them to accept it by threatening the funds for the
    existing Medicaid program. We cannot agree that existing
    Medicaid and the expansion dictated by the Affordable
    Care Act are all one program simply because “Congress
    styled” them as such. Post, at 49. If the expansion is not
    properly viewed as a modification of the existing Medicaid
    program, Congress’s decision to so title it is irrelevant.13
    ——————
      12 JUSTICE  GINSBURG observes that state Medicaid spending will in-
    crease by only 0.8 percent after the expansion. Post, at 43. That not
    only ignores increased state administrative expenses, but also assumes
    that the Federal Government will continue to fund the expansion at the
    current statutorily specified levels. It is not unheard of, however, for
    the Federal Government to increase requirements in such a manner as
    to impose unfunded mandates on the States. More importantly, the
    size of the new financial burden imposed on a State is irrelevant in
    analyzing whether the State has been coerced into accepting that
    burden. “Your money or your life” is a coercive proposition, whether
    you have a single dollar in your pocket or $500.
      13 Nor, of course, can the number of pages the amendment occu-
    
    pies, or the extent to which the change preserves and works within
    the existing program, be dispositive. Cf. post, at 49–50 (opinion of
    GINSBURG, J.). Take, for example, the following hypothetical amend-
    ment: “All of a State’s citizens are now eligible for Medicaid.” That
    change would take up a single line and would not alter any “operational
    aspect[ ] of the program” beyond the eligibility requirements. Post, at
    49. Yet it could hardly be argued that such an amendment was a
    permissible modification of Medicaid, rather than an attempt to foist an
    entirely new health care system upon the States.

                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
       Here, the Government claims that the Medicaid expan-
    sion is properly viewed merely as a modification of the ex-
    isting program because the States agreed that Congress
    could change the terms of Medicaid when they signed on
    in the first place. The Government observes that the
    Social Security Act, which includes the original Medicaid
    provisions, contains a clause expressly reserving “[t]he
    right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision” of that
    statute. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1304. So it does. But “if Congress
    intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal mon-
    eys, it must do so unambiguously.” Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,
    at 17. A State confronted with statutory language reserv-
    ing the right to “alter” or “amend” the pertinent provisions
    of the Social Security Act might reasonably assume that
    Congress was entitled to make adjustments to the Medi-
    caid program as it developed. Congress has in fact done
    so, sometimes conditioning only the new funding, other
    times both old and new. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-
    ments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1381–1382, 1465 (extending Med-
    icaid eligibility, but partly conditioning only the new
    funding); Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,
    §4601, 104 Stat. 1388–166 (extending eligibility, and
    conditioning old and new funds).
       The Medicaid expansion, however, accomplishes a shift
    in kind, not merely degree. The original program was de-
    signed to cover medical services for four particular cat-
    egories of the needy: the disabled, the blind, the elderly,
    and needy families with dependent children. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396a(a)(10). Previous amendments to Medicaid
    eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of
    these categories. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid
    is transformed into a program to meet the health care
    needs of the entire nonelderly population with income
    below 133 percent of the poverty level. It is no longer a
    program to care for the neediest among us, but rather an
    element of a comprehensive national plan to provide uni-
    54         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    versal health insurance coverage.14
       Indeed, the manner in which the expansion is struc-
    tured indicates that while Congress may have styled the
    expansion a mere alteration of existing Medicaid, it recog-
    nized it was enlisting the States in a new health care
    program. Congress created a separate funding provision
    to cover the costs of providing services to any person
    made newly eligible by the expansion. While Congress pays
    50 to 83 percent of the costs of covering individuals cur-
    rently enrolled in Medicaid, §1396d(b), once the expansion is
    fully implemented Congress will pay 90 percent of the
    costs for newly eligible persons, §1396d(y)(1). The condi-
    tions on use of the different funds are also distinct. Con-
    gress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level
    of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional
    Medicaid benefit package. §1396a(k)(1); see Brief for
    United States 9.
       As we have explained, “[t]hough Congress’ power to
    legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not
    include surprising participating States with postac-
    ceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.” Pennhurst, supra, at
    25. A State could hardly anticipate that Congress’s reser-
    vation of the right to “alter” or “amend” the Medicaid
    program included the power to transform it so dramatically.
       JUSTICE GINSBURG claims that in fact this expansion is
    ——————
       14 JUSTICE GINSBURG suggests that the States can have no objection to
    
    the Medicaid expansion, because “Congress could have repealed Medi-
    caid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new
    program combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage
    required by the ACA.” Post, at 51; see also post, at 38. But it would
    certainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit,
    if not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing
    program and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political
    reconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be “ritual-
    istic.” Ibid. The same is true of JUSTICE GINSBURG’s suggestion that
    Congress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.
    Post, at 44.

    no different from the previous changes to Medicaid, such
    that “a State would be hard put to complain that it lacked
    fair notice.” Post, at 56. But the prior change she dis-
    cusses—presumably the most dramatic alteration she could
    find—does not come close to working the transformation
    the expansion accomplishes. She highlights an amend-
    ment requiring States to cover pregnant women and in-
    creasing the number of eligible children. Ibid. But this
    modification can hardly be described as a major change in
    a program that—from its inception—provided health care
    for “families with dependent children.” Previous Medicaid
    amendments simply do not fall into the same category as
    the one at stake here.
       The Court in Steward Machine did not attempt to “fix
    the outermost line” where persuasion gives way to coer-
    cion. 301 U. S., at 591. The Court found it “[e]nough for
    present purposes that wherever the line may be, this
    statute is within it.” Ibid. We have no need to fix a line
    either. It is enough for today that wherever that line may
    be, this statute is surely beyond it. Congress may not
    simply “conscript state [agencies] into the national bu-
    reaucratic army,” FERC v. Mississippi,

    (1982) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and
    dissenting in part), and that is what it is attempting to do
    with the Medicaid expansion.
                                  B
      Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering
    funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the availa-
    bility of health care, and requiring that States accepting
    such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What
    Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose
    not to participate in that new program by taking away
    their existing Medicaid funding. Section 1396c gives the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to
    56       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    do just that. It allows her to withhold all “further [Medi-
    caid] payments . . . to the State” if she determines that the
    State is out of compliance with any Medicaid requirement,
    including those contained in the expansion. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §1396c. In light of the Court’s holding, the Secretary
    cannot apply §1396c to withdraw existing Medicaid funds
    for failure to comply with the requirements set out in the
    expansion.
       That fully remedies the constitutional violation we have
    identified. The chapter of the United States Code that
    contains §1396c includes a severability clause confirming
    that we need go no further. That clause specifies that “[i]f
    any provision of this chapter, or the application thereof to
    any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder
    of the chapter, and the application of such provision to
    other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.”
    §1303. Today’s holding does not affect the continued ap-
    plication of §1396c to the existing Medicaid program. Nor
    does it affect the Secretary’s ability to withdraw funds pro-
    vided under the Affordable Care Act if a State that has
    chosen to participate in the expansion fails to comply with
    the requirements of that Act.
       This is not to say, as the joint dissent suggests, that we
    are “rewriting the Medicaid Expansion.” Post, at 48.
    Instead, we determine, first, that §1396c is unconstitu-
    tional when applied to withdraw existing Medicaid funds
    from States that decline to comply with the expansion.
    We then follow Congress’s explicit textual instruction to
    leave unaffected “the remainder of the chapter, and the
    application of [the challenged] provision to other persons
    or circumstances.” §1303. When we invalidate an applica-
    tion of a statute because that application is unconstitu-
    tional, we are not “rewriting” the statute; we are merely
    enforcing the Constitution.
       The question remains whether today’s holding affects
    other provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In considering

    would have intended in light of the Court’s constitutional
    holding.” United States v. Booker,

    (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our “touch-

    , 330
    (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). The question
    here is whether Congress would have wanted the rest of
    the Act to stand, had it known that States would have a
    genuine choice whether to participate in the new Medicaid
    expansion. Unless it is “evident” that the answer is no, we
    must leave the rest of the Act intact. Champlin Refining
    Co. v. Corporation Comm’n of Okla.,

    , 234
    (1932).
      We are confident that Congress would have wanted to
    preserve the rest of the Act. It is fair to say that Congress
    assumed that every State would participate in the Medi-
    caid expansion, given that States had no real choice but to
    do so. The States contend that Congress enacted the rest
    of the Act with such full participation in mind; they point
    out that Congress made Medicaid a means for satisfying
    the mandate, 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(f)(1)(A)(ii), and enacted
    no other plan for providing coverage to many low-income
    individuals. According to the States, this means that the
    entire Act must fall.
      We disagree. The Court today limits the financial pres-
    sure the Secretary may apply to induce States to accept
    the terms of the Medicaid expansion. As a practical mat-
    ter, that means States may now choose to reject the ex-
    pansion; that is the whole point. But that does not mean
    all or even any will. Some States may indeed decline to
    participate, either because they are unsure they will be
    able to afford their share of the new funding obligations,
    or because they are unwilling to commit the administra-
    58       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    tive resources necessary to support the expansion. Other
    States, however, may voluntarily sign up, finding the idea
    of expanding Medicaid coverage attractive, particularly
    given the level of federal funding the Act offers at the
    outset.
       We have no way of knowing how many States will ac-
    cept the terms of the expansion, but we do not believe
    Congress would have wanted the whole Act to fall, simply
    because some may choose not to participate. The other
    reforms Congress enacted, after all, will remain “fully
    operative as a law,” Champlin, supra, at 234, and will still
    function in a way “consistent with Congress’ basic objec-
    tives in enacting the statute,” Booker, supra, at 259.
    Confident that Congress would not have intended any-
    thing different, we conclude that the rest of the Act need
    not fall in light of our constitutional holding.
                            *     *   *
      The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and
    unconstitutional in part. The individual mandate cannot
    be upheld as an exercise of Congress’s power under the
    Commerce Clause. That Clause authorizes Congress to
    regulate interstate commerce, not to order individuals to
    engage in it. In this case, however, it is reasonable to con-
    strue what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those
    who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go
    without health insurance. Such legislation is within Con-
    gress’s power to tax.
      As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Af-
    fordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening
    existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to
    order the States to regulate according to its instructions.
    Congress may offer the States grants and require the
    States to comply with accompanying conditions, but the
    States must have a genuine choice whether to accept the
    offer. The States are given no such choice in this case:
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                 59
    
                       Opinion of ROBERTS, C. J.
    
    They must either accept a basic change in the nature of
    Medicaid, or risk losing all Medicaid funding. The remedy
    for that constitutional violation is to preclude the Federal
    Government from imposing such a sanction. That remedy
    does not require striking down other portions of the Af-
    fordable Care Act.
      The Framers created a Federal Government of limited
    powers, and assigned to this Court the duty of enforcing
    those limits. The Court does so today. But the Court does
    not express any opinion on the wisdom of the Affordable
    Care Act. Under the Constitution, that judgment is re-
    served to the people.
      The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit is affirmed in part and reversed in part.
    
                                                      It is so ordered.

       JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
    joins, and with whom JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE
    KAGAN join as to Parts I, II, III, and IV, concurring in
    part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in
    part.
       I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the Anti-Injunction
    Act does not bar the Court’s consideration of this case,
    and that the minimum coverage provision is a proper
    exercise of Congress’ taxing power. I therefore join Parts
    I, II, and III–C of THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion.
    Unlike THE CHIEF JUSTICE, however, I would hold, alterna­
    2        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    tively, that the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to
    enact the minimum coverage provision. I would also hold
    that the Spending Clause permits the Medicaid expansion
    exactly as Congress enacted it.
                                 I
       The provision of health care is today a concern of na­
    tional dimension, just as the provision of old-age and
    survivors’ benefits was in the 1930’s. In the Social Secu-
    rity Act, Congress installed a federal system to provide
    monthly benefits to retired wage earners and, eventually,
    to their survivors. Beyond question, Congress could have
    adopted a similar scheme for health care. Congress chose,
    instead, to preserve a central role for private insurers and
    state governments. According to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the
    Commerce Clause does not permit that preservation. This
    rigid reading of the Clause makes scant sense and is
    stunningly retrogressive.
       Since 1937, our precedent has recognized Congress’
    large authority to set the Nation’s course in the economic
    and social welfare realm. See United States v. Darby,

    commerce no matter what the source of the dangers which

    CHIEF JUSTICE’s crabbed reading of the Commerce Clause
    harks back to the era in which the Court routinely thwarted
    Congress’ efforts to regulate the national economy in
    the interest of those who labor to sustain it. See, e.g.,
    Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co.,

    By any measure, that market is immense. Collectively,

    accounting for 17.6% of our Nation’s economy.

       The health-care market’s size is not its only distinctive
    feature. Unlike the market for almost any other product
    or service, the market for medical care is one in which all
    individuals inevitably participate. Virtually every person
    residing in the United States, sooner or later, will visit
    a doctor or other health-care professional. See Dept. of
    Health and Human Services, National Center for Health
    Statistics, Summary Health Statistics for U. S. Adults:
    National Health Interview Survey 2009, Ser. 10, No. 249,
    p. 124, Table 37 (Dec. 2010) (Over 99.5% of adults above
    65 have visited a health-care professional.). Most people
    will do so repeatedly. See id., at 115, Table 34 (In 2009
    alone, 64% of adults made two or more visits to a doctor’s
    office.).
       When individuals make those visits, they face another
    reality of the current market for medical care: its high
    cost. In 2010, on average, an individual in the United
    States incurred over $7,000 in health-care expenses.

    Alemayahu & Warner, The Lifetime Distribution of
    Health Care Costs, in 39 Health Service Research 627, 635
    (June 2004). When a person requires nonroutine care, the
    cost will generally exceed what he or she can afford to pay.
    A single hospital stay, for instance, typically costs up­
    wards of $10,000. See Dept. of Health and Human Ser­
    vices, Office of Health Policy, ASPE Research Brief: The
    Value of Health Insurance 5 (May 2011). Treatments for
    many serious, though not uncommon, conditions similarly
    cost a substantial sum. Brief for Economic Scholars as

    ing that, in 1998, the cost of treating a heart attack for the
    first 90 days exceeded $20,000, while the annual cost of
    treating certain cancers was more than $50,000).
       Although every U. S. domiciliary will incur significant
    medical expenses during his or her lifetime, the time when
    care will be needed is often unpredictable. An accident, a
    heart attack, or a cancer diagnosis commonly occurs with­
    out warning. Inescapably, we are all at peril of needing
    medical care without a moment’s notice. See, e.g., Camp­
    bell, Down the Insurance Rabbit Hole, N. Y. Times, Apr. 5,
    2012, p. A23 (telling of an uninsured 32-year-old woman
    who, healthy one day, became a quadriplegic the next due
    to an auto accident).
       To manage the risks associated with medical care—
    its high cost, its unpredictability, and its inevitability—
    most people in the United States obtain health insurance.
    Many (approximately 170 million in 2009) are insured by
    private insurance companies. Others, including those
    over 65 and certain poor and disabled persons, rely on
    government-funded insurance programs, notably Medicare
    and Medicaid. Combined, private health insurers and
    State and Federal Governments finance almost 85% of the

    gressional Budget Office, CBO’s 2011 Long-Term Budget
    Outlook 37 (June 2011).
       Not all U. S. residents, however, have health insurance.
    In 2009, approximately 50 million people were uninsured,
    either by choice or, more likely, because they could not
    afford private insurance and did not qualify for govern­
    ment aid. See Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, C.

    and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009,
    p. 23, Table 8 (Sept. 2010). As a group, uninsured individ­
    uals annually consume more than $100 billion in health-

      The large number of individuals without health insur­
    ance, Congress found, heavily burdens the national
    health-care market. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2). As just
    noted, the cost of emergency care or treatment for a seri­
    ous illness generally exceeds what an individual can afford
    to pay on her own. Unlike markets for most products,
    however, the inability to pay for care does not mean that
    an uninsured individual will receive no care. Federal and
    state law, as well as professional obligations and embed­
    ded social norms, require hospitals and physicians to
    provide care when it is most needed, regardless of the
    patient’s ability to pay. See, e.g.,

       As a consequence, medical-care providers deliver sig-
    nificant amounts of care to the uninsured for which the
    providers receive no payment. In 2008, for example, hospi-
    tals, physicians, and other health-care professionals
    received no compensation for $43 billion worth of the $116
    billion in care they administered to those without insur­
    ance. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(F) (2006 ed., Supp. IV).
       Health-care providers do not absorb these bad debts.
    Instead, they raise their prices, passing along the cost
    of uncompensated care to those who do pay reliably: the
    government and private insurance companies. In response,
    private insurers increase their premiums, shifting the
    cost of the elevated bills from providers onto those who
    carry insurance. The net result: Those with health insur­
    ance subsidize the medical care of those without it. As
    economists would describe what happens, the uninsured
    “free ride” on those who pay for health insurance.
       The size of this subsidy is considerable. Congress found
    that the cost-shifting just described “increases family
    [insurance] premiums by on average over $1,000 a year.”
    Ibid. Higher premiums, in turn, render health insurance
    less affordable, forcing more people to go without insur­
    ance and leading to further cost-shifting.
       And it is hardly just the currently sick or injured among
    the uninsured who prompt elevation of the price of health
    care and health insurance. Insurance companies and
    health-care providers know that some percentage of
    healthy, uninsured people will suffer sickness or injury
    each year and will receive medical care despite their ina­
    bility to pay. In anticipation of this uncompensated care,
    health-care companies raise their prices, and insurers
    their premiums. In other words, because any uninsured

    person may need medical care at any moment and because
    health-care companies must account for that risk, every
    uninsured person impacts the market price of medical care
    and medical insurance.
       The failure of individuals to acquire insurance has other
    deleterious effects on the health-care market. Because
    those without insurance generally lack access to preventa­
    tive care, they do not receive treatment for conditions—
    like hypertension and diabetes—that can be successfully
    and affordably treated if diagnosed early on. See Institute
    of Medicine, National Academies, Insuring America’s
    Health: Principles and Recommendations 43 (2004). When
    sickness finally drives the uninsured to seek care, once
    treatable conditions have escalated into grave health
    problems, requiring more costly and extensive interven­
    tion. Id., at 43–44. The extra time and resources provid­
    ers spend serving the uninsured lessens the providers’
    ability to care for those who do have insurance. See Kliff,

      States cannot resolve the problem of the uninsured on
    their own. Like Social Security benefits, a universal

    would be “bait to the needy and dependent elsewhere,
    encouraging them to migrate and seek a haven of repose.”

    Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 15 (noting that, in 2009, Massa­
    chusetts’ emergency rooms served thousands of uninsured,
    out-of-state residents). An influx of unhealthy individuals
    into a State with universal health care would result in
    increased spending on medical services. To cover the
    increased costs, a State would have to raise taxes, and
    private health-insurance companies would have to in­
    crease premiums. Higher taxes and increased insurance
    costs would, in turn, encourage businesses and healthy
    individuals to leave the State.
      States that undertake health-care reforms on their own
    thus risk “placing themselves in a position of economic
    disadvantage as compared with neighbors or competitors.”

    of-state residents continue to seek and receive millions of
    dollars in uncompensated care in Massachusetts hospitals,
    limiting the State’s efforts to improve its health care

    Facing that risk, individual States are unlikely to take the
    initiative in addressing the problem of the uninsured, even
    though solving that problem is in all States’ best interests.
    Congress’ intervention was needed to overcome this collective­
    action impasse.

      Aware that a national solution was required, Congress
    could have taken over the health-insurance market by
    establishing a tax-and-spend federal program like Social
    Security. Such a program, commonly referred to as a
    single-payer system (where the sole payer is the Federal
    Government), would have left little, if any, room for pri­
    vate enterprise or the States. Instead of going this route,
    Congress enacted the ACA, a solution that retains a ro­
    bust role for private insurers and state governments. To
    make its chosen approach work, however, Congress had to

    use some new tools, including a requirement that most
    individuals obtain private health insurance coverage. See
    

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A (2006 ed., Supp. IV) (the minimum
    coverage provision). As explained below, by employing
    these tools, Congress was able to achieve a practical, alto­
    gether reasonable, solution.
      A central aim of the ACA is to reduce the number of
    uninsured U. S. residents. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(C)
    and (I) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). The minimum coverage
    provision advances this objective by giving potential recip­
    ients of health care a financial incentive to acquire insur­
    ance. Per the minimum coverage provision, an individual
    must either obtain insurance or pay a toll constructed as a
    tax penalty. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A.
      The minimum coverage provision serves a further pur­
    pose vital to Congress’ plan to reduce the number of unin­
    sured. Congress knew that encouraging individuals to
    purchase insurance would not suffice to solve the problem,
    because most of the uninsured are not uninsured by
    choice.1 Of particular concern to Congress were people
    who, though desperately in need of insurance, often cannot
    acquire it: persons who suffer from preexisting medical
    conditions.
      Before the ACA’s enactment, private insurance compa­
    nies took an applicant’s medical history into account when
    setting insurance rates or deciding whether to insure an
    individual. Because individuals with preexisting med-

      1 According to one study conducted by the National Center for Health
    
    Statistics, the high cost of insurance is the most common reason why
    individuals lack coverage, followed by loss of one’s job, an employer’s
    unwillingness to offer insurance or an insurers’ unwillingness to cover
    those with preexisting medical conditions, and loss of Medicaid cover­
    age. See Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Center for

    ical conditions cost insurance companies significantly more
    than those without such conditions, insurers routinely re-
    fused to insure these individuals, charged them substan­
    tially higher premiums, or offered only limited coverage
    that did not include the preexisting illness. See Dept. of
    Health and Human Services, Coverage Denied: How the
    Current Health Insurance System Leaves Millions Behind
    1 (2009) (Over the past three years, 12.6 million non­
    elderly adults were denied insurance coverage or charged
    higher premiums due to a preexisting condition.).
       To ensure that individuals with medical histories have
    access to affordable insurance, Congress devised a three­
    part solution. First, Congress imposed a “guaranteed is­
    sue” requirement, which bars insurers from denying
    coverage to any person on account of that person’s medical
    condition or history. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§300gg–1, 300gg–3,
    300gg–4(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Second, Congress required
    insurers to use “community rating” to price their insurance
    policies. See §300gg. Community rating, in effect, bars
    insurance companies from charging higher premiums
    to those with preexisting conditions.
       But these two provisions, Congress comprehended, could
    not work effectively unless individuals were given a pow­
    erful incentive to obtain insurance. See Hearings before
    the House Ways and Means Committee, 111th Cong., 1st
    Sess., 10, 13 (2009) (statement of Uwe Reinhardt) (“[I]m-
    position of community-rated premiums and guaranteed
    issue on a market of competing private health insurers
    will inexorably drive that market into extinction, unless
    these two features are coupled with . . . a mandate on
    individual[s] to be insured.” (emphasis in original)).
       In the 1990’s, several States—including New York, New
    Jersey, Washington, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire,
    and Vermont—enacted guaranteed-issue and community­
    rating laws without requiring universal acquisition of
    insurance coverage. The results were disastrous. “All

    ington experienced when the State passed a law requiring
    coverage for preexisting conditions).
       Congress comprehended that guaranteed-issue and
    community-rating laws alone will not work. When insur­
    ance companies are required to insure the sick at afforda­
    ble prices, individuals can wait until they become ill to buy
    insurance. Pretty soon, those in need of immediate medi­
    cal care—i.e., those who cost insurers the most—become
    the insurance companies’ main customers. This “adverse
    selection” problem leaves insurers with two choices: They
    can either raise premiums dramatically to cover their
    ever-increasing costs or they can exit the market. In the
    seven States that tried guaranteed-issue and community­
    rating requirements without a minimum coverage provi­
    sion, that is precisely what insurance companies did. See,

    insurance, see Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 111M, §2 (West 2011),
    the Commonwealth ensured that insurers would not be
    left with only the sick as customers. As a result, federal
    lawmakers observed, Massachusetts succeeded where
    other States had failed. See Brief for Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts as Amicus Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 3 (not­
    ing that the Commonwealth’s reforms reduced the number
    of uninsured residents to less than 2%, the lowest rate in

       In sum, Congress passed the minimum coverage provi­
    sion as a key component of the ACA to address an econom­
    ic and social problem that has plagued the Nation for
    decades: the large number of U. S. residents who are
    unable or unwilling to obtain health insurance. Whatever
    one thinks of the policy decision Congress made, it was
    Congress’ prerogative to make it. Reviewed with appro­
    priate deference, the minimum coverage provision, allied
    to the guaranteed-issue and community-rating prescrip­
    tions, should survive measurement under the Commerce
    and Necessary and Proper Clauses.

    left to the States. This scheme proved unworkable, be­
    cause the individual States, understandably focused on
    their own economic interests, often failed to take actions

       3 Alexander Hamilton described the problem this way:         “[Often] it
    would be beneficial to all the states to encourage, or suppress[,] a
    particular branch of trade, while it would be detrimental . . . to attempt
    it without the concurrence of the rest.” The Continentalist No. V, in 3
    Papers of Alexander Hamilton 75, 78 (H. Syrett ed. 1962). Because the
    concurrence of all States was exceedingly difficult to obtain, Hamilton
    observed, “the experiment would probably be left untried.” Ibid.

       Until today, this Court’s pragmatic approach to judging
    whether Congress validly exercised its commerce power
    was guided by two familiar principles. First, Congress has
    the power to regulate economic activities “that substan­
    tially affect interstate commerce.” Gonzales v. Raich, 

[545 U.S. 1](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    , 17 (2005). This capacious power extends even to
    local activities that, viewed in the aggregate, have a sub­
    stantial impact on interstate commerce. See ibid. See
    also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125 (“[E]ven if appellee’s activ-
    ity be local and though it may not be regarded as com­
    merce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by
    Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on
    interstate commerce.” (emphasis added)); Jones & Laugh-
    lin Steel Corp., 301 U. S., at 37.
       Second, we owe a large measure of respect to Congress
    when it frames and enacts economic and social legislation.

    ask only (1) whether Congress had a “rational basis” for
    concluding that the regulated activity substantially affects
    interstate commerce, and (2) whether there is a “reasona­
    ble connection between the regulatory means selected and

                                   C
      Straightforward application of these principles would
    require the Court to hold that the minimum coverage
    provision is proper Commerce Clause legislation. Beyond
    dispute, Congress had a rational basis for concluding that
    the uninsured, as a class, substantially affect interstate
    commerce. Those without insurance consume billions of
    dollars of health-care products and services each year. See
    supra, at 5. Those goods are produced, sold, and delivered
    largely by national and regional companies who routinely
    transact business across state lines. The uninsured also
    cross state lines to receive care. Some have medical emer­
    gencies while away from home. Others, when sick, go to a
    neighboring State that provides better care for those who
    have not prepaid for care. See supra, at 7–8.
      Not only do those without insurance consume a large
    amount of health care each year; critically, as earlier
    explained, their inability to pay for a significant portion of
    that consumption drives up market prices, foists costs on
    other consumers, and reduces market efficiency and sta­
    bility. See supra, at 5–7. Given these far-reaching effects
    on interstate commerce, the decision to forgo insurance is
    hardly inconsequential or equivalent to “doing nothing,”
    ante, at 20; it is, instead, an economic decision Congress
                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)           17
    
                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.
    
    has the authority to address under the Commerce Clause.
    See supra, at 14–16. See also Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128
    (“It is well established by decisions of this Court that
    the power to regulate commerce includes the power to regu­
    late the prices at which commodities in that commerce are
    dealt in and practices affecting such prices.” (emphasis
    added)).
       The minimum coverage provision, furthermore, bears a
    “reasonable connection” to Congress’ goal of protecting the
    health-care market from the disruption caused by individ­
    uals who fail to obtain insurance. By requiring those who
    do not carry insurance to pay a toll, the minimum cover­
    age provision gives individuals a strong incentive to in­
    sure. This incentive, Congress had good reason to believe,
    would reduce the number of uninsured and, correspond­
    ingly, mitigate the adverse impact the uninsured have on
    the national health-care market.
       Congress also acted reasonably in requiring uninsured
    individuals, whether sick or healthy, either to obtain
    insurance or to pay the specified penalty. As earlier ob­
    served, because every person is at risk of needing care at
    any moment, all those who lack insurance, regardless of
    their current health status, adversely affect the price of
    health care and health insurance. See supra, at 6–7.
    Moreover, an insurance-purchase requirement limited to
    those in need of immediate care simply could not work.
    Insurance companies would either charge these individu­
    als prohibitively expensive premiums, or, if community­
    rating regulations were in place, close up shop. See supra,
    at 9–11. See also Brief for State of Maryland and 10
    Other States et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–398, p. 28
    (hereinafter Maryland Brief) (“No insurance regime can
    survive if people can opt out when the risk insured against
    is only a risk, but opt in when the risk materializes.”).
       “[W]here we find that the legislators . . . have a rational
    basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to
    18       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.”
    Katzenbach, 379 U. S., at 303–304. Congress’ enactment
    of the minimum coverage provision, which addresses a
    specific interstate problem in a practical, experience­
    informed manner, easily meets this criterion.
                                D
      Rather than evaluating the constitutionality of the
    minimum coverage provision in the manner established by
    our precedents, THE CHIEF JUSTICE relies on a newly
    minted constitutional doctrine. The commerce power does
    not, THE CHIEF JUSTICE announces, permit Congress
    to “compe[l] individuals to become active in commerce
    by purchasing a product.” Ante, at 20 (emphasis deleted).
                                 1
                                 a
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s novel constraint on Congress’
    commerce power gains no force from our precedent and for
    that reason alone warrants disapprobation. See infra, at
    23–27. But even assuming, for the moment, that Congress
    lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to “compel
    individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an
    unwanted product,” ante, at 18, such a limitation would be
    inapplicable here. Everyone will, at some point, consume
    health-care products and services. See supra, at 3. Thus,
    if THE CHIEF JUSTICE is correct that an insurance­
    purchase requirement can be applied only to those who
    “actively” consume health care, the minimum coverage
    provision fits the bill.
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE does not dispute that all U. S. resi­
    dents participate in the market for health services over
    the course of their lives. See ante, at 16 (“Everyone will
    eventually need health care at a time and to an extent
    they cannot predict.”). But, THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists,
    the uninsured cannot be considered active in the market
                         Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)                  19
    
                            Opinion of GINSBURG, J.
    
    for health care, because “[t]he proximity and degree of
    connection between the [uninsured today] and [their]
    subsequent commercial activity is too lacking.” Ante,
    at 27.
       This argument has multiple flaws. First, more than
    60% of those without insurance visit a hospital or doctor’s
    office each year. See supra, at 5. Nearly 90% will within
    five years.4 An uninsured’s consumption of health care is
    thus quite proximate: It is virtually certain to occur in the
    next five years and more likely than not to occur this year.
       Equally evident, Congress has no way of separating
    those uninsured individuals who will need emergency medi-
    cal care today (surely their consumption of medical care
    is sufficiently imminent) from those who will not need
    medical services for years to come. No one knows when an
    emergency will occur, yet emergencies involving the unin­
    sured arise daily. To capture individuals who unexpect-
    edly will obtain medical care in the very near future, then,
    Congress needed to include individuals who will not go to
    a doctor anytime soon. Congress, our decisions instruct,
    has authority to cast its net that wide. See Perez v. United
    States,

      5 Echoing THE CHIEF JUSTICE, the joint dissenters urge that the min­
    
    imum coverage provision impermissibly regulates young people who
    “have no intention of purchasing [medical care]” and are too far “re­
    moved from the [health-care] market.” See post, at 8, 11. This criticism
    ignores the reality that a healthy young person may be a day away
    from needing health care. See supra, at 4. A victim of an accident or
    unforeseen illness will consume extensive medical care immediately,
    though scarcely expecting to do so.

       Second, it is Congress’ role, not the Court’s, to delineate
    the boundaries of the market the Legislature seeks to
    regulate. THE CHIEF JUSTICE defines the health-care mar-
    ket as including only those transactions that will occur
    either in the next instant or within some (unspecified)
    proximity to the next instant. But Congress could reason­
    ably have viewed the market from a long-term perspective,
    encompassing all transactions virtually certain to occur
    over the next decade, see supra, at 19, not just those oc­
    curring here and now.
       Third, contrary to THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s contention, our
    precedent does indeed support “[t]he proposition that
    Congress may dictate the conduct of an individual today
    because of prophesied future activity.” Ante, at 26. In
    Wickard, the Court upheld a penalty the Federal Govern­
    ment imposed on a farmer who grew more wheat than he
    was permitted to grow under the Agricultural Adjustment
    Act of 1938 (AAA). 317 U. S., at 114–115. He could not
    be penalized, the farmer argued, as he was growing the
    wheat for home consumption, not for sale on the open
    market. Id., at 119. The Court rejected this argument.
    Id., at 127–129. Wheat intended for home consumption,
    the Court noted, “overhangs the market, and if induced by
    rising prices, tends to flow into the market and check price
    increases [intended by the AAA].” Id., at 128.
       Similar reasoning supported the Court’s judgment in
    Raich, which upheld Congress’ authority to regulate mari­
    juana grown for personal use. 545 U. S., at 19. Home­
    grown marijuana substantially affects the interstate mar-
    ket for marijuana, we observed, for “the high demand in
    the interstate market will [likely] draw such marijuana
    into that market.” Ibid.
       Our decisions thus acknowledge Congress’ authority,
    under the Commerce Clause, to direct the conduct of an
    individual today (the farmer in Wickard, stopped from
    growing excess wheat; the plaintiff in Raich, ordered to
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          21
    
                        Opinion of GINSBURG, J.
    
    cease cultivating marijuana) because of a prophesied
    future transaction (the eventual sale of that wheat or
    marijuana in the interstate market). Congress’ actions
    are even more rational in this case, where the future
    activity (the consumption of medical care) is certain to
    occur, the sole uncertainty being the time the activity will
    take place.
       Maintaining that the uninsured are not active in the
    health-care market, THE CHIEF JUSTICE draws an analogy
    to the car market. An individual “is not ‘active in the car
    market,’ ” THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, simply because he
    or she may someday buy a car. Ante, at 25. The analogy
    is inapt. The inevitable yet unpredictable need for medi­
    cal care and the guarantee that emergency care will be
    provided when required are conditions nonexistent in
    other markets. That is so of the market for cars, and of
    the market for broccoli as well. Although an individual
    might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no
    certainty she will ever do so. And if she eventually wants
    a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to
    pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nour­
    ishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense
    of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price. See
    Thomas More Law Center v. Obama,

    (CA6 2011) (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“Regulating
    how citizens pay for what they already receive (health
    care), never quite know when they will need, and in the
    case of severe illnesses or emergencies generally will not

    life.”). Upholding the minimum coverage provision on the
    ground that all are participants or will be participants in
    the health-care market would therefore carry no implica­
    tion that Congress may justify under the Commerce
    Clause a mandate to buy other products and services.
       Nor is it accurate to say that the minimum coverage
    provision “compel[s] individuals . . . to purchase an un­

    wanted product,” ante, at 18, or “suite of products,” post, at
    11, n. 2 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and
    ALITO, JJ.). If unwanted today, medical service secured by
    insurance may be desperately needed tomorrow. Virtually
    everyone, I reiterate, consumes health care at some point
    in his or her life. See supra, at 3. Health insurance is a
    means of paying for this care, nothing more. In requiring
    individuals to obtain insurance, Congress is therefore not
    mandating the purchase of a discrete, unwanted product.
    Rather, Congress is merely defining the terms on which
    individuals pay for an interstate good they consume:
    Persons subject to the mandate must now pay for medical
    care in advance (instead of at the point of service) and
    through insurance (instead of out of pocket). Establishing
    payment terms for goods in or affecting interstate com­
    merce is quintessential economic regulation well within
    Congress’ domain. See, e.g., United States v. Wrightwood
    Dairy Co., 

[315 U.S. 110](/opinion/103600/united-states-v-wrightwood-dairy-co/)

    
    
    , 118 (1942). Cf. post, at 13 (joint
    opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.)
    (recognizing that “the Federal Government can prescribe
    [a commodity’s] quality . . . and even [its price]”).
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE also calls the minimum coverage
    provision an illegitimate effort to make young, healthy
    individuals subsidize insurance premiums paid by the less
    hale and hardy. See ante, at 17, 25–26. This complaint,
    too, is spurious. Under the current health-care system,
    healthy persons who lack insurance receive a benefit for
    which they do not pay: They are assured that, if they need
    it, emergency medical care will be available, although they
    cannot afford it. See supra, at 5–6. Those who have in­
    surance bear the cost of this guarantee. See ibid. By
    requiring the healthy uninsured to obtain insurance or
    pay a penalty structured as a tax, the minimum coverage
    provision ends the free ride these individuals currently
    enjoy.
       In the fullness of time, moreover, today’s young and

    healthy will become society’s old and infirm. Viewed over
    a lifespan, the costs and benefits even out: The young who
    pay more than their fair share currently will pay less than
    their fair share when they become senior citizens. And
    even if, as undoubtedly will be the case, some individuals,
    over their lifespans, will pay more for health insurance
    than they receive in health services, they have little to
    complain about, for that is how insurance works. Every
    insured person receives protection against a catastrophic
    loss, even though only a subset of the covered class will
    ultimately need that protection.
                                   b
       In any event, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s limitation of the
    commerce power to the regulation of those actively en­
    gaged in commerce finds no home in the text of the Consti­
    tution or our decisions. Article I, §8, of the Constitution
    grants Congress the power “[t]o regulate Commerce . . .
    among the several States.” Nothing in this language im-
    plies that Congress’ commerce power is limited to regu-
    lating those actively engaged in commercial transactions.
    Indeed, as the D. C. Circuit observed, “[a]t the time the
    Constitution was [framed], to ‘regulate’ meant,” among
    other things, “to require action.” See Seven-Sky v. Holder,
    

[661 F.3d 1](/opinion/616874/seven-sky-v-holder/)

    
    
    , 16 (2011).
       Arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE notes that
    “the Constitution gives Congress the power to ‘coin
    Money,’ in addition to the power to ‘regulate the Value
    thereof,’ ” and similarly “gives Congress the power to ‘raise
    and support Armies’ and to ‘provide and maintain a Navy,’ in
    addition to the power to ‘make Rules for the Government
    and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.’ ” Ante, at
    18–19 (citing Art. I, §8, cls. 5, 12–14). In separating the
    power to regulate from the power to bring the subject of
    the regulation into existence, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts,
    “[t]he language of the Constitution reflects the natural
    24         NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    understanding that the power to regulate assumes there is
    already something to be regulated.” Ante, at 19.
       This argument is difficult to fathom. Requiring individ­
    uals to obtain insurance unquestionably regulates the inter­
    state health-insurance and health-care markets, both of
    them in existence well before the enactment of the ACA.
    See Wickard, 317 U. S., at 128 (“The stimulation of com­
    merce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely
    as prohibitions or restrictions thereon.”). Thus, the “some­
    thing to be regulated” was surely there when Congress
    created the minimum coverage provision.6
       Nor does our case law toe the activity versus inactiv­
    ity line. In Wickard, for example, we upheld the penalty
    imposed on a farmer who grew too much wheat, even
    though the regulation had the effect of compelling farmers
    to purchase wheat in the open market. Id., at 127–129.
    “[F]orcing some farmers into the market to buy what they
    could provide for themselves” was, the Court held, a valid
    means of regulating commerce. Id., at 128–129. In an-
    other context, this Court similarly upheld Congress’ author­
    ity under the commerce power to compel an “inactive” land­
    holder to submit to an unwanted sale. See Monongahela
    Nav. Co. v. United States,

      6 THE  CHIEF JUSTICE’s reliance on the quoted passages of the Consti­
    tution, see ante, at 18–19, is also dubious on other grounds. The power
    to “regulate the Value” of the national currency presumably includes
    the power to increase the currency’s worth—i.e., to create value where
    none previously existed. And if the power to “[r]egulat[e] . . . the land
    and naval Forces” presupposes “there is already [in existence] some­
    thing to be regulated,” i.e., an Army and a Navy, does Congress lack
    authority to create an Air Force?

    regarding mandated sale of private property for railroad
    construction).
       In concluding that the Commerce Clause does not per­
    mit Congress to regulate commercial “inactivity,” and there-
    fore does not allow Congress to adopt the practical solu­
    tion it devised for the health-care problem, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE views the Clause as a “technical legal conception,”
    precisely what our case law tells us not to do. Wickard,
    317 U. S., at 122 (internal quotation marks omitted). See
    also supra, at 14–16. This Court’s former endeavors to
    impose categorical limits on the commerce power have not
    fared well. In several pre-New Deal cases, the Court
    attempted to cabin Congress’ Commerce Clause authority
    by distinguishing “commerce” from activity once conceived
    to be noncommercial, notably, “production,” “mining,” and
    “manufacturing.” See, e.g., United States v. E. C. Knight
    Co., 

[156 U.S. 1](/opinion/94079/united-states-v-ec-knight-co/)

    facture, and is not a part of it.”); Carter v. Carter Coal Co.,

    , 304 (1936) (“Mining brings the subject
    matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of
    it.”). The Court also sought to distinguish activities hav­
    ing a “direct” effect on interstate commerce, and for that
    reason, subject to federal regulation, from those having
    only an “indirect” effect, and therefore not amenable to
    federal control. See, e.g., A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.
    v. United States, 

[295 U.S. 495](/opinion/102474/ala-schechter-poultry-corp-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 548 (1935) (“[T]he dis-
    tinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate
    transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized
    as a fundamental one.”).
       These line-drawing exercises were untenable, and the
    Court long ago abandoned them. “[Q]uestions of the power
    of Congress [under the Commerce Clause],” we held in
    Wickard, “are not to be decided by reference to any for-
    mula which would give controlling force to nomenclature such
    as ‘production’ and ‘indirect’ and foreclose consideration of

    the actual effects of the activity in question upon inter­
    state commerce.” 317 U. S., at 120. See also Morrison,
    529 U. S., at 641–644 (Souter, J., dissenting) (recounting
    the Court’s “nearly disastrous experiment” with formalis­
    tic limits on Congress’ commerce power). Failing to learn
    from this history, THE CHIEF JUSTICE plows ahead with
    his formalistic distinction between those who are “active
    in commerce,” ante, at 20, and those who are not.
       It is not hard to show the difficulty courts (and Con­
    gress) would encounter in distinguishing statutes that reg­
    ulate “activity” from those that regulate “inactivity.” As
    Judge Easterbrook noted, “it is possible to restate most
    actions as corresponding inactions with the same effect.”

    , 1213 (CA7 1988) (en
    banc). Take this case as an example. An individual who
    opts not to purchase insurance from a private insurer can
    be seen as actively selecting another form of insurance:
    self-insurance. See Thomas More Law Center, 

651 F. 3d

    at 561 (Sutton, J., concurring in part) (“No one is in­
    active when deciding how to pay for health care, as self­
    insurance and private insurance are two forms of action
    for addressing the same risk.”). The minimum coverage
    provision could therefore be described as regulating activ­
    ists in the self-insurance market.7 Wickard is another
    example. Did the statute there at issue target activity
    (the growing of too much wheat) or inactivity (the farmer’s
    failure to purchase wheat in the marketplace)? If any­
    thing, the Court’s analysis suggested the latter. See 317

    to purchase private insurance as “doing nothing,” ante, at 20, is simi­
    larly questionable. A person who self-insures opts against prepayment for
    a product the person will in time consume. When aggregated, exercise
    of that option has a substantial impact on the health-care market. See

       Underlying THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view that the Com­
    merce Clause must be confined to the regulation of active
    participants in a commercial market is a fear that the
    commerce power would otherwise know no limits. See,
    e.g., ante, at 23 (Allowing Congress to compel an individ-
    ual not engaged in commerce to purchase a product would
    “permi[t] Congress to reach beyond the natural extent
    of its authority, everywhere extending the sphere of its

    express a similar apprehension. See post, at 8 (If the
    minimum coverage provision is upheld under the com­
    merce power then “the Commerce Clause becomes a font of
    unlimited power, . . . the hideous monster whose devour­
    ing jaws . . . spare neither sex nor age, nor high nor low,
    nor sacred nor profane.” (internal quotation marks omit­
    ted)). This concern is unfounded.
       First, THE CHIEF JUSTICE could certainly uphold the
    individual mandate without giving Congress carte blanche
    to enact any and all purchase mandates. As several times
    noted, the unique attributes of the health-care market
    render everyone active in that market and give rise to a
    significant free-riding problem that does not occur in other
    markets. See supra, at 3–7, 16–18, 21.
       Nor would the commerce power be unbridled, absent
    THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s “activity” limitation. Congress would
    remain unable to regulate noneconomic conduct that has
    only an attenuated effect on interstate commerce and is
    traditionally left to state law. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at
    567; Morrison, 529 U. S., at 617–619. In Lopez, for
    example, the Court held that the Federal Government
    lacked power, under the Commerce Clause, to criminalize
    the possession of a gun in a local school zone. Possessing
    a gun near a school, the Court reasoned, “is in no sense
    an economic activity that might, through repetition else­
    where, substantially affect any sort of interstate com­
    merce.” 514 U. S., at 567; ibid. (noting that the Court
    would have “to pile inference upon inference” to conclude
    that gun possession has a substantial effect on commerce).
    Relying on similar logic, the Court concluded in Morrison
    that Congress could not regulate gender-motivated vio­
    lence, which the Court deemed to have too “attenuated
    [an] effect upon interstate commerce.” 529 U. S., at 615.
       An individual’s decision to self-insure, I have explained,
    is an economic act with the requisite connection to inter­
    state commerce. See supra, at 16–17. Other choices

    individuals make are unlikely to fit the same or similar
    description. As an example of the type of regulation he
    fears, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites a Government mandate to
    purchase green vegetables. Ante, at 22–23. One could call
    this concern “the broccoli horrible.” Congress, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE posits, might adopt such a mandate, reasoning
    that an individual’s failure to eat a healthy diet, like the
    failure to purchase health insurance, imposes costs on
    others. See ibid.
       Consider the chain of inferences the Court would have
    to accept to conclude that a vegetable-purchase mandate
    was likely to have a substantial effect on the health-care
    costs borne by lithe Americans. The Court would have to
    believe that individuals forced to buy vegetables would
    then eat them (instead of throwing or giving them away),
    would prepare the vegetables in a healthy way (steamed
    or raw, not deep-fried), would cut back on unhealthy foods,
    and would not allow other factors (such as lack of exercise
    or little sleep) to trump the improved diet.9 Such “pil[ing
    of] inference upon inference” is just what the Court re­
    fused to do in Lopez and Morrison.
       Other provisions of the Constitution also check congres­
    sional overreaching. A mandate to purchase a particu-
    lar product would be unconstitutional if, for example, the
    edict impermissibly abridged the freedom of speech, inter­
    fered with the free exercise of religion, or infringed on a
    liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.
    ——————
      9 The failure to purchase vegetables in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s hypothet­
    
    ical, then, is not what leads to higher health-care costs for others;
    rather, it is the failure of individuals to maintain a healthy diet, and
    the resulting obesity, that creates the cost-shifting problem. See ante,
    at 22–23. Requiring individuals to purchase vegetables is thus
    several steps removed from solving the problem. The failure to obtain
    health insurance, by contrast, is the immediate cause of the cost-shifting
    Congress sought to address through the ACA. See supra, at 5–7.
    Requiring individuals to obtain insurance attacks the source of the
    problem directly, in a single step.

       Supplementing these legal restraints is a formidable
    check on congressional power: the democratic process. See
    Raich, 545 U. S., at 33; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120 (repeat­
    ing Chief Justice Marshall’s “warning that effective re­

    bons v. Ogden, 

[9 Wheat. 1](/opinion/85412/gibbons-v-ogden/)

    
    
    , 197 (1824)). As the controversy
    surrounding the passage of the Affordable Care Act at­
    tests, purchase mandates are likely to engender political
    resistance. This prospect is borne out by the behavior of
    state legislators. Despite their possession of unquestioned
    authority to impose mandates, state governments have
    rarely done so. See Hall, Commerce Clause Challenges to
    Health Care Reform, 159 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1825, 1838 (2011).
       When contemplated in its extreme, almost any power
    looks dangerous. The commerce power, hypothetically,
    would enable Congress to prohibit the purchase and home
    production of all meat, fish, and dairy goods, effectively
    compelling Americans to eat only vegetables. Cf. Raich,
    545 U. S., at 9; Wickard, 317 U. S., at 127–129. Yet no one

    ian state as a credible reason to deny Congress the author­
    ity ever to ban the possession and sale of goods. THE

    ion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (assert­
    ing, outlandishly, that if the minimum coverage provision
    is sustained, then Congress could make “breathing in and

       To bolster his argument that the minimum coverage
    provision is not valid Commerce Clause legislation, THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE emphasizes the provision’s novelty. See

    indication of [a] severe constitutional problem . . . is the
    lack of historical precedent for Congress’s action” (internal

    mandate may be novel, THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s argument
    certainly is not. “[I]n almost every instance of the exer-
    cise of the [commerce] power differences are asserted from
    previous exercises of it and made a ground of attack.”

       Recall that one of Congress’ goals in enacting the Af­
    fordable Care Act was to eliminate the insurance indus­
    try’s practice of charging higher prices or denying coverage
    to individuals with preexisting medical conditions. See
    supra, at 9–10. The commerce power allows Congress to
    ban this practice, a point no one disputes. See United

    rating requirements would trigger an adverse-selection
    death-spiral in the health-insurance market: Insurance
    premiums would skyrocket, the number of uninsured
    would increase, and insurance companies would exit the
    market. See supra, at 10–11. When complemented by an
    insurance mandate, on the other hand, guaranteed issue
    and community rating would work as intended, increasing
    access to insurance and reducing uncompensated care.
    See supra, at 11–12. The minimum coverage provision is
    thus an “essential par[t] of a larger regulation of economic
    activity”; without the provision, “the regulatory scheme
    [w]ould be undercut.” Raich, 545 U. S., at 24–25 (inter-
    nal quotation marks omitted). Put differently, the mini­
    mum coverage provision, together with the guaranteed­
    issue and community-rating requirements, is “ ‘reasonably
    adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end under
    the commerce power”: the elimination of pricing and
    sales practices that take an applicant’s medical history
    into account. See id., at 37 (SCALIA, J., concurring in
    judgment).
                                B
      Asserting that the Necessary and Proper Clause does
    not authorize the minimum coverage provision, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE focuses on the word “proper.” A mandate to
    purchase health insurance is not “proper” legislation, THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE urges, because the command “under­
    mine[s] the structure of government established by the
    Constitution.” Ante, at 28. If long on rhetoric, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE’s argument is short on substance.
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites only two cases in which this
    Court concluded that a federal statute impermissibly
    transgressed the Constitution’s boundary between state
    and federal authority: Printz v. United States, 

[521 U.S. 898](/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/)

    
    
     (1997), and New York v. United States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
     (1992). See ante, at 29. The statutes at issue in

    both cases, however, compelled state officials to act on the
    Federal Government’s behalf. 521 U. S., at 925–933 (hold­
    ing unconstitutional a statute obligating state law en­
    forcement officers to implement a federal gun-control law);
    New York, 505 U. S., at 176–177 (striking down a statute
    requiring state legislators to pass regulations pursuant to
    Congress’ instructions). “[Federal] laws conscripting state
    officers,” the Court reasoned, “violate state sovereignty
    and are thus not in accord with the Constitution.” Printz,
    521 U. S., at 925, 935; New York, 505 U. S., at 176.
       The minimum coverage provision, in contrast, acts
    “directly upon individuals, without employing the States
    as intermediaries.” New York, 505 U. S., at 164. The
    provision is thus entirely consistent with the Consti­
    tution’s design. See Printz, 521 U. S., at 920 (“[T]he
    Framers explicitly chose a Constitution that confers upon
    Congress the power to regulate individuals, not States.”
    (internal quotation marks omitted)).
       Lacking case law support for his holding, THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE nevertheless declares the minimum coverage
    provision not “proper” because it is less “narrow in scope”
    than other laws this Court has upheld under the Neces­
    sary and Proper Clause. Ante, at 29 (citing United States
    v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___ (2010); Sabri v. United States,

    which this Court has affirmed Congress’ “broad authority
    to enact federal legislation” under the Necessary and
    Proper Clause, Comstock, 560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5),
    is underwhelming.
       Nor does THE CHIEF JUSTICE pause to explain why the
    power to direct either the purchase of health insurance or,
    alternatively, the payment of a penalty collectible as a tax
    is more far-reaching than other implied powers this Court
    has found meet under the Necessary and Proper Clause.
    These powers include the power to enact criminal laws,

    power to alter the way a state law is applied in state court,
    where the alteration “promotes fair and efficient operation
    of the federal courts”).10
       In failing to explain why the individual mandate threat­
    ens our constitutional order, THE CHIEF JUSTICE disserves
    future courts. How is a judge to decide, when ruling on
    the constitutionality of a federal statute, whether Con­
    gress employed an “independent power,” ante, at 28, or
    merely a “derivative” one, ante, at 29. Whether the power
    used is “substantive,” ante, at 30, or just “incidental,” ante,
    at 29? The instruction THE CHIEF JUSTICE, in effect,
    provides lower courts: You will know it when you see it.
       It is more than exaggeration to suggest that the mini­
    mum coverage provision improperly intrudes on “essential
    attributes of state sovereignty.” Ibid. (internal quotation

    ment plays a lead role in the health-care sector, both as a
    direct payer and as a regulator.
      Second, and perhaps most important, the minimum
    coverage provision, along with other provisions of the
    ACA, addresses the very sort of interstate problem that
    made the commerce power essential in our federal system.
    See supra, at 12–14. The crisis created by the large num­
    ber of U. S. residents who lack health insurance is one of
    national dimension that States are “separately incompe­
    tent” to handle. See supra, at 7–8, 13. See also Maryland
    Brief 15–26 (describing “the impediments to effective state
    policymaking that flow from the interconnectedness of
    each state’s healthcare economy” and emphasizing that
    “state-level reforms cannot fully address the problems
    associated with uncompensated care”). Far from tram­
    pling on States’ sovereignty, the ACA attempts a federal
    solution for the very reason that the States, acting sepa­
    rately, cannot meet the need. Notably, the ACA serves the
    general welfare of the people of the United States while
    retaining a prominent role for the States. See id., at 31–
    36 (explaining and illustrating how the ACA affords States
    wide latitude in implementing key elements of the Act’s
    reforms).11
    ——————
      11 In a separate argument, the joint dissenters contend that the min­
    
    imum coverage provision is not necessary and proper because it was not
    the “only . . . way” Congress could have made the guaranteed-issue and
    community-rating reforms work. Post, at 9–10. Congress could also
    have avoided an insurance-market death spiral, the dissenters main­
    tain, by imposing a surcharge on those who did not previously purchase
    insurance when those individuals eventually enter the health­
    insurance system. Post, at 10. Or Congress could “den[y] a full income
    tax credit” to those who do not purchase insurance. Ibid.
         Neither a surcharge on those who purchase insurance nor the de­
    nial of a tax credit to those who do not would solve the problem created
    by guaranteed-issue and community-rating requirements. Neither
    would prompt the purchase of insurance before sickness or injury
    occurred.

       In the early 20th century, this Court regularly struck
    down economic regulation enacted by the peoples’ repre­
    sentatives in both the States and the Federal Government.
    See, e.g., Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S., at 303–304, 309–310;

    , 64 (1905). THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s Commerce
    Clause opinion, and even more so the joint dissenters’
    reasoning, see post, at 4–16, bear a disquieting resem­
    blance to those long-overruled decisions.
       Ultimately, the Court upholds the individual mandate
    as a proper exercise of Congress’ power to tax and spend
    “for the . . . general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,
    §8, cl. 1; ante, at 43–44. I concur in that determination,
    which makes THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s Commerce Clause
    essay all the more puzzling. Why should THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE strive so mightily to hem in Congress’ capacity to
    meet the new problems arising constantly in our ever­
    developing modern economy? I find no satisfying response
    to that question in his opinion.12
    ——————
         But even assuming there were “practicable” alternatives to the
    minimum coverage provision, “we long ago rejected the view that the
    Necessary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress be
    ‘absolutely necessary’ to the exercise of an enumerated power.” Jinks
    v. Richland County,

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 414–415 (1819)). Rather, the statutory
    provision at issue need only be “conducive” and “[reasonably] adapted”
    to the goal Congress seeks to achieve. Jinks, 538 U. S., at 462 (internal
    quotation marks omitted). The minimum coverage provision meets this
    requirement. See supra, at 31–33.
      12 THE CHIEF JUSTICE states that he must evaluate the constitution­
    
    ality of the minimum coverage provision under the Commerce Clause
    because the provision “reads more naturally as a command to buy
    insurance than as a tax.” Ante, at 44. THE CHIEF JUSTICE ultimately
    concludes, however, that interpreting the provision as a tax is a “fairly
    possible” construction. Ante, at 32 (internal quotation marks omitted).
    That being so, I see no reason to undertake a Commerce Clause analy­
    sis that is not outcome determinative.

                                  V
       Through Medicaid, Congress has offered the States an
    opportunity to furnish health care to the poor with the aid
    of federal financing. To receive federal Medicaid funds,
    States must provide health benefits to specified categories
    of needy persons, including pregnant women, children,
    parents, and adults with disabilities. Guaranteed eligibil­
    ity varies by category: for some it is tied to the federal
    poverty level (incomes up to 100% or 133%); for others it
    depends on criteria such as eligibility for designated state
    or federal assistance programs. The ACA enlarges the
    population of needy people States must cover to include
    adults under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the fed-
    eral poverty level. The spending power conferred by the
    Constitution, the Court has never doubted, permits Con­
    gress to define the contours of programs financed with
    federal funds. See, e.g., Pennhurst State School and Hos-
    pital v. Halderman, 

[451 U.S. 1](/opinion/110458/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/)

    
    
    , 17 (1981). And to expand
    coverage, Congress could have recalled the existing legis­
    lation, and replaced it with a new law making Medicaid as
    embracive of the poor as Congress chose.
       The question posed by the 2010 Medicaid expansion,
    then, is essentially this: To cover a notably larger popula­
    tion, must Congress take the repeal/reenact route, or may
    it achieve the same result by amending existing law? The
    answer should be that Congress may expand by amend­
    ment the classes of needy persons entitled to Medicaid
    benefits. A ritualistic requirement that Congress repeal
    and reenact spending legislation in order to enlarge the
    population served by a federally funded program would
    advance no constitutional principle and would scarcely
    serve the interests of federalism. To the contrary, such a
    requirement would rigidify Congress’ efforts to empower
    States by partnering with them in the implementation of
    federal programs.
       Medicaid is a prototypical example of federal-state coop­
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          39

    eration in serving the Nation’s general welfare. Rather
    than authorizing a federal agency to administer a uni-
    form national health-care system for the poor, Con-
    gress offered States the opportunity to tailor Medicaid
    grants to their particular needs, so long as they remain
    within bounds set by federal law. In shaping Medicaid,
    Congress did not endeavor to fix permanently the terms
    participating states must meet; instead, Congress re­
    served the “right to alter, amend, or repeal” any provision
    of the Medicaid Act. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1304. States, for their
    part, agreed to amend their own Medicaid plans consistent
    with changes from time to time made in the federal law.
    See 42 CFR §430.12(c)(i) (2011). And from 1965 to the
    present, States have regularly conformed to Congress’
    alterations of the Medicaid Act.
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE acknowledges that Congress may
    “condition the receipt of [federal] funds on the States’
    complying with restrictions on the use of those funds,”
    ante, at 50, but nevertheless concludes that the 2010
    expansion is unduly coercive. His conclusion rests on
    three premises, each of them essential to his theory. First,
    the Medicaid expansion is, in THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s view, a
    new grant program, not an addition to the Medicaid pro­
    gram existing before the ACA’s enactment. Congress, THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, has threatened States with the
    loss of funds from an old program in an effort to get them
    to adopt a new one. Second, the expansion was unforesee­
    able by the States when they first signed on to Medicaid.
    Third, the threatened loss of funding is so large that the
    States have no real choice but to participate in the Medi­
    caid expansion. THE CHIEF JUSTICE therefore—for the
    first time ever—finds an exercise of Congress’ spending
    power unconstitutionally coercive.
       Medicaid, as amended by the ACA, however, is not two
    spending programs; it is a single program with a constant
    aim—to enable poor persons to receive basic health care
    40       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

                      Opinion of GINSBURG, J. 
    
    
    when they need it. Given past expansions, plus express
    statutory warning that Congress may change the re­
    quirements participating States must meet, there can be
    no tenable claim that the ACA fails for lack of notice.
    Moreover, States have no entitlement to receive any Medi­
    caid funds; they enjoy only the opportunity to accept funds
    on Congress’ terms. Future Congresses are not bound
    by their predecessors’ dispositions; they have authority to
    spend federal revenue as they see fit. The Federal Gov­
    ernment, therefore, is not, as THE CHIEF JUSTICE charges,
    threatening States with the loss of “existing” funds from
    one spending program in order to induce them to opt into
    another program. Congress is simply requiring States to
    do what States have long been required to do to receive
    Medicaid funding: comply with the conditions Congress
    prescribes for participation.
       A majority of the Court, however, buys the argument
    that prospective withholding of funds formerly available
    exceeds Congress’ spending power. Given that holding, I
    entirely agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE as to the appropri­
    ate remedy. It is to bar the withholding found impermis­
    sible—not, as the joint dissenters would have it, to scrap
    the expansion altogether, see post, at 46–48. The dissent­
    ers’ view that the ACA must fall in its entirety is a radical
    departure from the Court’s normal course. When a consti­
    tutional infirmity mars a statute, the Court ordinarily
    removes the infirmity. It undertakes a salvage operation;
    it does not demolish the legislation. See, e.g., Brockett v.
    Spokane Arcades, Inc., 

[472 U.S. 491](/opinion/111480/brockett-v-spokane-arcades-inc/)

    
    
    , 504 (1985) (Court’s
    normal course is to declare a statute invalid “to the extent
    that it reaches too far, but otherwise [to leave the statute]
    intact”). That course is plainly in order where, as in this
    case, Congress has expressly instructed courts to leave
    untouched every provision not found invalid. See 

42 U.S. C

    patible with the Spending Clause, Congress’ extension of
    Medicaid remains available to any State that affirms its
    willingness to participate.
                                  A
       Expansion has been characteristic of the Medicaid pro­
    gram. Akin to the ACA in 2010, the Medicaid Act as
    passed in 1965 augmented existing federal grant programs
    jointly administered with the States.13 States were not
    required to participate in Medicaid. But if they did, the
    Federal Government paid at least half the costs. To qual-
    ify for these grants, States had to offer a minimum level of
    health coverage to beneficiaries of four federally funded,
    state-administered welfare programs: Aid to Families with
    Dependent Children; Old Age Assistance; Aid to the Blind;
    and Aid to the Permanently and Totally Disabled. See
    Social Security Amendments of 1965, §121(a), 79 Stat.

[453 U.S. 34](/opinion/110547/schweiker-v-gray-panthers/)

    
    
    , 37 (1981).
    At their option, States could enroll additional “medically
    needy” individuals; these costs, too, were partially borne by
    the Federal Government at the same, at least 50%, rate.

       Since 1965, Congress has amended the Medicaid pro­

       Between 1966 and 1990, annual federal Medicaid spend­
    ing grew from $631.6 million to $42.6 billion; state
    spending rose to $31 billion over the same period. See Dept.
    of Health and Human Services, National Health Expendi­
    tures by Type of Service and Source of Funds: Calendar
    Years 1960 to 2010 (table).14 And between 1990 and 2010,
    federal spending increased to $269.5 billion. Ibid. En­
    largement of the population and services covered by Medi­
    caid, in short, has been the trend.
       Compared to past alterations, the ACA is notable for the
    extent to which the Federal Government will pick up the
    tab. Medicaid’s 2010 expansion is financed largely by
    federal outlays. In 2014, federal funds will cover 100%
    of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries; that rate will
    gradually decrease before settling at 90% in 2020.

       Nor will the expansion exorbitantly increase state Medi­
    caid spending. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
    projects that States will spend 0.8% more than they would
    have, absent the ACA. See CBO, Spending & Enrollment
    Detail for CBO’s March 2009 Baseline. But see ante, at

    KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.) (“[A]cceptance of the

    obligations after the ACA, it will pale in comparison to the
    increase in federal funding.15

    acknowledgment of the considerable autonomy States

    would bear if the[re] were no health reform.” See Kaiser Commission
    on Medicaid & the Uninsured, Medicaid Coverage & Spending in
    Health Reform 16 (May 2010). Thus there can be no objection to the
    ACA’s expansion of Medicaid as an “unfunded mandate.” Quite the
    contrary, the program is impressively well funded.

    dramatically different levels of funding and coverage,
    alter and experiment with different financing and delivery
    modes, and opt to cover (or not to cover) a range of parti-
    cular procedures and therapies. States have leveraged
    this policy discretion to generate a myriad of dramatically
    different Medicaid programs over the past several dec­
    ades.” Ruger, Of Icebergs and Glaciers, 75 Law & Con­
    temp. Probs. 215, 233 (2012) (footnote omitted). The ACA
    does not jettison this approach. States, as first-line ad­
    ministrators, will continue to guide the distribution of
    substantial resources among their needy populations.
       The alternative to conditional federal spending, it bears
    emphasis, is not state autonomy but state marginaliza­
    tion.16 In 1965, Congress elected to nationalize health
    coverage for seniors through Medicare. It could similarly
    have established Medicaid as an exclusively federal pro­
    gram. Instead, Congress gave the States the opportunity
    to partner in the program’s administration and develop­
    ment. Absent from the nationalized model, of course, is
    the state-level policy discretion and experimentation that
    is Medicaid’s hallmark; undoubtedly the interests of fed­
    eralism are better served when States retain a meaning-
    ful role in the implementation of a program of such
    importance. See Caminker, State Sovereignty and Sub­
    ordinacy, 95 Colum. L. Rev. 1001, 1002–1003 (1995) (coopera-

       Congress’ authority to condition the use of federal funds

[483 U.S. 203](/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/)

    
    
    (1987), the Court identified four criteria. The conditions
    placed on federal grants to States must (a) promote the
    “general welfare,” (b) “unambiguously” inform States what
    is demanded of them, (c) be germane “to the federal inter­

    , 590 (1937)). Prior to today’s deci­
    sion, however, the Court has never ruled that the terms of
    any grant crossed the indistinct line between temptation
    and coercion.
       Dole involved the National Minimum Drinking Age Act,
    

23 U.S. C

    
    
    . §158, enacted in 1984. That Act directed the
    Secretary of Transportation to withhold 5% of the federal
    highway funds otherwise payable to a State if the State
    permitted purchase of alcoholic beverages by persons
    less than 21 years old. Drinking age was not within the
    authority of Congress to regulate, South Dakota argued,
    because the Twenty-First Amendment gave the States
    exclusive power to control the manufacture, transporta­
    tion, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The small
    percentage of highway-construction funds South Dakota
    stood to lose by adhering to 19 as the age of eligibility to
    purchase 3.2% beer, however, was not enough to qualify as
    coercion, the Court concluded.
       This case does not present the concerns that led the
    Court in Dole even to consider the prospect of coercion. In
    Dole, the condition—set 21 as the minimum drinking age—
    did not tell the States how to use funds Congress pro-
    vided for highway construction. Further, in view of the
    Twenty-First Amendment, it was an open question whether
    Congress could directly impose a national minimum
    drinking age.
       The ACA, in contrast, relates solely to the federally
    funded Medicaid program; if States choose not to comply,
    Congress has not threatened to withhold funds earmarked
    for any other program. Nor does the ACA use Medicaid
    funding to induce States to take action Congress itself
    could not undertake. The Federal Government undoubt­
    edly could operate its own health-care program for poor
    persons, just as it operates Medicare for seniors’ health

    care. See supra, at 44.
      That is what makes this such a simple case, and the
    Court’s decision so unsettling. Congress, aiming to assist
    the needy, has appropriated federal money to subsidize
    state health-insurance programs that meet federal stand­
    ards. The principal standard the ACA sets is that the
    state program cover adults earning no more than 133% of
    the federal poverty line. Enforcing that prescription en­
    sures that federal funds will be spent on health care for
    the poor in furtherance of Congress’ present perception of
    the general welfare.
                                   C
      THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the Medicaid expan­
    sion creates a “new health care program.” Ante, at 54.
    Moreover, States could “hardly anticipate” that Congress
    would “transform [the program] so dramatically.” Ante,
    at 55. Therefore, THE CHIEF JUSTICE maintains, Congress’
    threat to withhold “old” Medicaid funds based on a State’s
    refusal to participate in the “new” program is a “threa[t] to
    terminate [an]other . . . independent gran[t].” Ante, at 50,
    52–53. And because the threat to withhold a large amount
    of funds from one program “leaves the States with no real
    option but to acquiesce [in a newly created program],” THE
    CHIEF JUSTICE concludes, the Medicaid expansion is un­
    constitutionally coercive. Ante, at 52.
                                1
      The starting premise on which THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s
    coercion analysis rests is that the ACA did not really
    “extend” Medicaid; instead, Congress created an entirely
    new program to co-exist with the old. THE CHIEF JUSTICE
    calls the ACA new, but in truth, it simply reaches more of
    America’s poor than Congress originally covered.
      Medicaid was created to enable States to provide medi­
    cal assistance to “needy persons.” See S. Rep. No. 404,
                     Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)          49

    89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 9 (1965). See also §121(a),
    79 Stat. 343 (The purpose of Medicaid is to enable States
    “to furnish . . . medical assistance on behalf of [certain
    persons] whose income and resources are insufficient to
    meet the costs of necessary medical services.”). By bring­
    ing health care within the reach of a larger population of
    Americans unable to afford it, the Medicaid expansion is
    an extension of that basic aim.
       The Medicaid Act contains hundreds of provisions gov­
    erning operation of the program, setting conditions rang­
    ing from “Limitation on payments to States for expend-
    itures attributable to taxes,” 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396a(t) (2006
    ed.), to “Medical assistance to aliens not lawfully admitted
    for permanent residence,” §1396b(v) (2006 ed. and Supp.
    IV). The Medicaid expansion leaves unchanged the vast
    majority of these provisions; it adds beneficiaries to the
    existing program and specifies the rate at which States
    will be reimbursed for services provided to the added bene-
    ficiaries. See ACA §§2001(a)(1), (3), 124 Stat. 271–272.
    The ACA does not describe operational aspects of the
    program for these newly eligible persons; for that infor­
    mation, one must read the existing Medicaid Act. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§1396–1396v(b) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).
       Congress styled and clearly viewed the Medicaid expan­
    sion as an amendment to the Medicaid Act, not as a “new”
    health-care program. To the four categories of beneficiar­
    ies for whom coverage became mandatory in 1965, and the
    three mandatory classes added in the late 1980’s, see
    supra, at 41–42, the ACA adds an eighth: individuals
    under 65 with incomes not exceeding 133% of the federal
    poverty level. The expansion is effectuated by §2001 of the
    ACA, aptly titled: “Medicaid Coverage for the Lowest
    Income Populations.” 124 Stat. 271. That section amends
    Title 42, Chapter 7, Subchapter XIX: Grants to States for
    Medical Assistance Programs. Commonly known as the
    Medicaid Act, Subchapter XIX filled some 278 pages in

       Congress has broad authority to construct or adjust
    spending programs to meet its contemporary understand­
    ing of “the general Welfare.” Helvering v. Davis, 

[301 U.S. 619](/opinion/102844/helvering-v-davis/)

    
    
    , 640–641 (1937). Courts owe a large measure of re­
    spect to Congress’ characterization of the grant programs
    it establishes. See Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 594.
    Even if courts were inclined to second-guess Congress’
    conception of the character of its legislation, how would
    reviewing judges divine whether an Act of Congress, pur­
    porting to amend a law, is in reality not an amendment,
    but a new creation? At what point does an extension
    become so large that it “transforms” the basic law?
       Endeavoring to show that Congress created a new pro­
    gram, THE CHIEF JUSTICE cites three aspects of the ex­
    pansion. First, he asserts that, in covering those earning
    no more than 133% of the federal poverty line, the Medi­
    caid expansion, unlike pre-ACA Medicaid, does not “care
    for the neediest among us.” Ante, at 53. What makes
    that so? Single adults earning no more than $14,856 per
    year—133% of the current federal poverty level—surely
    rank among the Nation’s poor.
       Second, according to THE CHIEF JUSTICE, “Congress
    mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of
    coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional
    Medicaid benefit package.” Ibid. That less comprehensive
    benefit package, however, is not an innovation introduced
    by the ACA; since 2006, States have been free to use it for
    many of their Medicaid beneficiaries.20 The level of bene­

    fits offered therefore does not set apart post-ACA Medicaid
    recipients from all those entitled to benefits pre-ACA.
       Third, THE CHIEF JUSTICE correctly notes that the
    reimbursement rate for participating States is differ­
    ent regarding individuals who became Medicaid-eligible
    through the ACA. Ibid. But the rate differs only in its
    generosity to participating States. Under pre-ACA Medi­
    caid, the Federal Government pays up to 83% of the costs
    of coverage for current enrollees, §1396d(b) (2006 ed. and
    Supp. IV); under the ACA, the federal contribution starts
    at 100% and will eventually settle at 90%, §1396d(y).
    Even if one agreed that a change of as little as 7 percent­
    age points carries constitutional significance, is it not
    passing strange to suggest that the purported incursion on
    state sovereignty might have been averted, or at least
    mitigated, had Congress offered States less money to carry
    out the same obligations?
       Consider also that Congress could have repealed Medi­
    caid. See supra, at 38–39 (citing 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1304); Brief
    for Petitioners in No. 11–400, p. 41. Thereafter, Congress
    could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combin­
    ing the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage

    .
       In Pennhurst, residents of a state-run, federally funded
    institution for the mentally disabled complained of abu­
    sive treatment and inhumane conditions in alleged viola­
    tion of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill
    of Rights Act. 451 U. S., at 5–6. We held that the State
    was not answerable in damages for violating conditions
    it did not “voluntarily and knowingly accep[t].” Id., at 17,
    27. Inspecting the statutory language and legislative his­
    tory, we found that the Act did not “unambiguously” im­
    pose the requirement on which the plaintiffs relied: that
    they receive appropriate treatment in the least restrictive
    environment. Id., at 17–18. Satisfied that Congress had
    not clearly conditioned the States’ receipt of federal funds
    on the States’ provision of such treatment, we declined to
    read such a requirement into the Act. Congress’ spending
    power, we concluded, “does not include surprising partici­
    pating States with postacceptance or ‘retroactive’ condi­
    tions.” Id., at 24–25.
       Pennhurst thus instructs that “if Congress intends to
    impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must
    do so unambiguously.” Ante, at 53 (quoting Pennhurst,
    451 U. S., at 17). That requirement is met in this case.
    Section 2001 does not take effect until 2014. The ACA
    makes perfectly clear what will be required of States that
    accept Medicaid funding after that date: They must extend
    eligibility to adults with incomes no more than 133% of
    the federal poverty line. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396a(a)(10)(A)
    (i)(VIII) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE appears to find in Pennhurst a
    requirement that, when spending legislation is first
    passed, or when States first enlist in the federal program,
    Congress must provide clear notice of conditions it might
    later impose. If I understand his point correctly, it was
    incumbent on Congress, in 1965, to warn the States clearly

    of the size and shape potential changes to Medicaid might
    take. And absent such notice, sizable changes could not be
    made mandatory. Our decisions do not support such a
    requirement.21

     (1985), the
    Secretary of Education sought to recoup Title I funds22
    based on the State’s noncompliance, from 1970 to 1972,
    with a 1978 amendment to Title I. Relying on Pennhurst,
    we rejected the Secretary’s attempt to recover funds based
    on the States’ alleged violation of a rule that did not exist
    when the State accepted and spent the funds. See 470
    U. S., at 640 (“New Jersey[,] when it applied for and re­
    ceived Title I funds for the years 1970–1972[,] had no
    basis to believe that the propriety of the expenditures
    would be judged by any standards other than the ones in
    effect at the time.” (citing Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17, 24–
    25; emphasis added)).
       When amendment of an existing grant program has no
    such retroactive effect, however, we have upheld Congress’
    instruction. In Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed.,

    the Commonwealth suffered no surprise after accepting
    the federal funds. Kentucky was therefore obliged to re-
    turn the money. 470 U. S., at 665–666, 673–674. The
    conditions imposed were to be assessed as of 1974, in light
    of “the legal requirements in place when the grants were
    made,” id., at 670, not as of 1965, when Title I was origi­
    nally enacted.
        As these decisions show, Pennhurst’s rule demands that
    conditions on federal funds be unambiguously clear at the
    time a State receives and uses the money—not at the time,
    perhaps years earlier, when Congress passed the law
    establishing the program. See also Dole, 483 U. S., at 208
    (finding Pennhurst satisfied based on the clarity of the
    Federal Aid Highway Act as amended in 1984, without
    looking back to 1956, the year of the Act’s adoption).
        In any event, from the start, the Medicaid Act put
    States on notice that the program could be changed: “The
    right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of [Medi­
    caid],” the statute has read since 1965, “is hereby reserved
    to the Congress.”

    right to “alter, amend, [or] repeal” a spending program,
    Congress “has given special notice of its intention to retain
    . . . full and complete power to make such alterations and
    amendments . . . as come within the just scope of legisla­

    , 51–52 (1986), is
    guiding here. As enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act
    did not cover state employees. Id., at 44. In response to
    pressure from States that wanted coverage for their em­
    ployees, Congress, in 1950, amended the Act to allow
    States to opt into the program. Id., at 45. The statutory

    provision giving States this option expressly permitted
    them to withdraw from the program. Ibid.
       Beginning in the late 1970’s, States increasingly exer­
    cised the option to withdraw. Id., at 46. Concerned that
    withdrawals were threatening the integrity of Social
    Security, Congress repealed the termination provision.
    Congress thereby changed Social Security from a program
    voluntary for the States to one from which they could not
    escape. Id., at 48. California objected, arguing that the
    change impermissibly deprived it of a right to withdraw
    from Social Security. Id., at 49–50. We unanimously
    rejected California’s argument. Id., at 51–53. By includ­
    ing in the Act “a clause expressly reserving to it ‘[t]he
    right to alter, amend, or repeal any provision’ of the Act,”
    we held, Congress put States on notice that the Act
    “created no contractual rights.” Id., at 51–52. The States
    therefore had no law-based ground on which to complain
    about the amendment, despite the significant character of
    the change.
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE nevertheless would rewrite §1304
    to countenance only the “right to alter somewhat,” or
    “amend, but not too much.” Congress, however, did not so
    qualify §1304. Indeed, Congress retained discretion to
    “repeal” Medicaid, wiping it out entirely. Cf. Delta Air
    Lines, Inc. v. August, 

[450 U.S. 346](/opinion/110429/delta-air-lines-inc-v-august/)

    
    
    , 368 (1981) (Rehnquist,
    J., dissenting) (invoking “the common-sense maxim that
    the greater includes the lesser”). As Bowen indicates, no
    State could reasonably have read §1304 as reserving to
    Congress authority to make adjustments only if modestly
    sized.
       In fact, no State proceeded on that understanding. In com­
    pliance with Medicaid regulations, each State expressly
    undertook to abide by future Medicaid changes. See 42
    CFR §430.12(c)(1) (2011) (“The [state Medicaid] plan must
    provide that it will be amended whenever necessary to
    reflect . . . [c]hanges in Federal law, regulations, policy

    interpretations, or court decisions.”). Whenever a State
    notifies the Federal Government of a change in its own
    Medicaid program, the State certifies both that it knows
    the federally set terms of participation may change, and
    that it will abide by those changes as a condition of con­
    tinued participation. See, e.g., Florida Agency for Health
    Care Admin., State Plan Under Title XIX of the Social
    Security Act Medical Assistance Program §7.1, p. 86 (Oct.
    6, 1992).
       THE CHIEF JUSTICE insists that the most recent expan­
    sion, in contrast to its predecessors, “accomplishes a shift
    in kind, not merely degree.” Ante, at 53. But why was
    Medicaid altered only in degree, not in kind, when Con­
    gress required States to cover millions of children and
    pregnant women? See supra, at 41–42. Congress did not
    “merely alte[r] and expan[d] the boundaries of ” the Aid to
    Families with Dependent Children program. But see ante,
    at 53–55. Rather, Congress required participating States
    to provide coverage tied to the federal poverty level (as it
    later did in the ACA), rather than to the AFDC program.
    See Brief for National Health Law Program et al. as Amici
    Curiae 16–18. In short, given §1304, this Court’s con­
    struction of §1304’s language in Bowen, and the enlarge­
    ment of Medicaid in the years since 1965,23 a State would
    be hard put to complain that it lacked fair notice when,
    in 2010, Congress altered Medicaid to embrace a larger
    portion of the Nation’s poor.

    (internal quotation marks omitted). The financial in­
    ducement Congress employed here, he concludes, crosses
    that threshold: The threatened withholding of “existing
    Medicaid funds” is “a gun to the head” that forces States to
    acquiesce. Ante, at 50–51 (citing

       THE CHIEF JUSTICE sees no need to “fix the outermost
    line,” Steward Machine, 301 U. S., at 591, “where persua­
    sion gives way to coercion,” ante, at 55. Neither do the
    joint dissenters. See post, at 36, 38.25 Notably, the deci­

       24 The joint dissenters, for their part, would make this the entire in­
    
    quiry. “[I]f States really have no choice other than to accept the pack­
    age,” they assert, “the offer is coercive.” Post, at 35. THE CHIEF JUSTICE
    recognizes Congress’ authority to construct a single federal program
    and “condition the receipt of funds on the States’ complying with
    restrictions on the use of those funds.” Ante, at 50. For the joint
    dissenters, however, all that matters, it appears, is whether States can
    resist the temptation of a given federal grant. Post, at 35. On this
    logic, any federal spending program, sufficiently large and well-funded,
    would be unconstitutional. The joint dissenters point to smaller pro­
    grams States might have the will to refuse. See post, at 40–41 (elemen­
    tary and secondary education). But how is a court to judge whether
    “only 6.6% of all state expenditures,” post, at 41, is an amount States
    could or would do without?
       Speculations of this genre are characteristic of the joint dissent. See,
    e.g., post, at 35 (“it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of
    public disapproval” for joint federal-state endeavors); ibid., (“federal
    officials . . . may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of
    their decision”); post, at 37 (“a heavy federal tax . . . levied to support a
    federal program that offers large grants to the States . . . may, as a
    practical matter, [leave States] unable to refuse to participate”); ibid.
    (withdrawal from a federal program “would likely force the State to
    impose a huge tax increase”); post, at 46 (state share of ACA expansion
    costs “may increase in the future”) (all emphasis added; some internal
    quotation marks omitted). The joint dissenters are long on conjecture
    and short on real-world examples.
       25 The joint dissenters also rely heavily on Congress’ perceived intent
    
    to coerce the States. Post, at 42–46; see, e.g., post, at 42 (“In crafting the
    ACA, Congress clearly expressed its informed view that no State could

    sion on which they rely, Steward Machine, found the
    statute at issue inside the line, “wherever the line may
    be.” 301 U. S., at 591.
       When future Spending Clause challenges arrive, as they
    likely will in the wake of today’s decision, how will liti­
    gants and judges assess whether “a State has a legitimate
    choice whether to accept the federal conditions in ex­
    change for federal funds”? Ante, at 48. Are courts to
    measure the number of dollars the Federal Government
    might withhold for noncompliance? The portion of the
    State’s budget at stake? And which State’s—or States’—
    budget is determinative: the lead plaintiff, all challenging
    States (26 in this case, many with quite different fiscal
    situations), or some national median? Does it matter that
    Florida, unlike most States, imposes no state income tax,
    and therefore might be able to replace foregone federal
    funds with new state revenue?26 Or that the coercion state
    ——————
    possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.”). We should not lightly
    ascribe to Congress an intent to violate the Constitution (at least as my
    colleagues read it). This is particularly true when the ACA could just
    as well be comprehended as demonstrating Congress’ mere expectation,
    in light of the uniformity of past participation and the generosity of the
    federal contribution, that States would not withdraw. Cf. South Dakota
    v. Dole, 

[483 U.S. 203](/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/)

    
    
    , 211 (1987) (“We cannot conclude . . . that a con­
    ditional grant of federal money . . . is unconstitutional simply by
    reason of its success in achieving the congressional objective.”).
       26 Federal taxation of a State’s citizens, according to the joint dissent­
    
    ers, may diminish a State’s ability to raise new revenue. This, in turn,
    could limit a State’s capacity to replace a federal program with an
    “equivalent” state-funded analog. Post, at 40. But it cannot be true
    that “the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the taxpayers of a
    State to pay for the program in question is relevant in determining
    whether there is impermissible coercion.” Post, at 37. When the
    United States Government taxes United States citizens, it taxes them
    “in their individual capacities” as “the people of America”—not as
    residents of a particular State. See U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,

    officials in fact fear is punishment at the ballot box for
    turning down a politically popular federal grant?
       The coercion inquiry, therefore, appears to involve polit-
    ical judgments that defy judicial calculation. See Baker
    v. Carr, 

[369 U.S. 186](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    , 217 (1962). Even commentators
    sympathetic to robust enforcement of Dole’s limitations,
    see supra, at 46, have concluded that conceptions of
    “impermissible coercion” premised on States’ perceived
    inability to decline federal funds “are just too amorphous
    to be judicially administrable.” Baker & Berman, Getting

    U. Chi. L. Rev. 1175 (1989)).
       At bottom, my colleagues’ position is that the States’
    reliance on federal funds limits Congress’ authority to
    alter its spending programs. This gets things backwards:
    Congress, not the States, is tasked with spending federal
    money in service of the general welfare. And each succes­
    sive Congress is empowered to appropriate funds as it sees
    fit. When the 110th Congress reached a conclusion about
    Medicaid funds that differed from its predecessors’ view,
    it abridged no State’s right to “existing,” or “pre-existing,”
    funds. But see ante, at 51–52; post, at 47–48 (joint opinion
    of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ.). For, in

    relationship” to the people. Id., at 838.
       A State therefore has no claim on the money its residents pay in
    federal taxes, and federal “spending programs need not help people in
    all states in the same measure.” See Brief for David Satcher et al. as
    Amici Curiae 19. In 2004, for example, New Jersey received 55 cents
    in federal spending for every dollar its residents paid to the Federal
    Government in taxes, while Mississippi received $1.77 per tax dollar
    paid. C. Dubay, Tax Foundation, Federal Tax Burdens and Expendi­
    tures by State: Which States Gain Most from Federal Fiscal Opera­
    tions? 2 (Mar. 2006). Thus no constitutional problem was created when
    Arizona declined for 16 years to participate in Medicaid, even though
    its residents’ tax dollars financed Medicaid programs in every other
    State.

      But in view of THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s disposition, I agree
    with him that the Medicaid Act’s severability clause de­
    termines the appropriate remedy. That clause provides
    that “[i]f any provision of [the Medicaid Act], or the appli­
    cation thereof to any person or circumstance, is held in-
    valid, the remainder of the chapter, and the application of
    such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not
    be affected thereby.”

      27 As THE CHIEF JUSTICE observes, the Secretary is authorized to
    withhold all of a State’s Medicaid funding. See ante, at 51. But total
    withdrawal is what the Secretary may, not must, do. She has discre­
    tion to withhold only a portion of the Medicaid funds otherwise due a
    noncompliant State. See §1396c; cf. 45 CFR §80.10(f) (2011) (Secretary
    may enforce Title VI’s nondiscrimination requirement through “refusal
    to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part.”
    (emphasis added)). The Secretary, it is worth noting, may herself
    experience political pressures, which would make her all the more
    reluctant to cut off funds Congress has appropriated for a State’s needy
    citizens.

    ACA. It prohibits only the “application” of the Secretary’s
    authority to withhold Medicaid funds from States that
    decline to conform their Medicaid plans to the ACA’s
    requirements. Thus the ACA’s authorization of funds to
    finance the expansion remains intact, and the Secretary’s
    authority to withhold funds for reasons other than non­
    compliance with the expansion remains unaffected.
       Even absent §1303’s command, we would have no war­
    rant to invalidate the Medicaid expansion, contra post, at
    46–48 (joint opinion of SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and
    ALITO, JJ.), not to mention the entire ACA, post, at 49–64
    (same). For when a court confronts an unconstitutional
    statute, its endeavor must be to conserve, not destroy,
    the legislature’s dominant objective. See, e.g., Ayotte v.
    Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.,

    ,
    328–330 (2006). In this case, that objective was to in­
    crease access to health care for the poor by increasing the
    States’ access to federal funds. THE CHIEF JUSTICE is
    undoubtedly right to conclude that Congress may offer
    States funds “to expand the availability of health care, and
    requir[e] that States accepting such funds comply with the
    conditions on their use.” Ante, at 55. I therefore concur
    in the judgment with respect to Part IV–B of THE CHIEF
    JUSTICE’s opinion.

      For the reasons stated, I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE
    that, as to the validity of the minimum coverage provi­
    sion, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
    Circuit should be reversed. In my view, the provision en-
    counters no constitutional obstruction. Further, I would
    uphold the Eleventh Circuit’s decision that the Medicaid
    expansion is within Congress’ spending power.

              APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIRCUIT
                               [June 28, 2012]
    
      JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE KENNEDY, JUSTICE THOMAS,
    and JUSTICE ALITO, dissenting.
      Congress has set out to remedy the problem that the
    best health care is beyond the reach of many Americans
    who cannot afford it. It can assuredly do that, by exercis-
    ing the powers accorded to it under the Constitution. The
    question in this case, however, is whether the complex
    structures and provisions of the Patient Protection and
    Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act or ACA) go be-
    yond those powers. We conclude that they do.
      This case is in one respect difficult: it presents two
    2       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 
    
                       BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
    
           SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    
    questions of first impression. The first of those is whether
    failure to engage in economic activity (the purchase of
    health insurance) is subject to regulation under the Com-
    merce Clause. Failure to act does result in an effect
    on commerce, and hence might be said to come under
    this Court’s “affecting commerce” criterion of Commerce
    Clause jurisprudence. But in none of its decisions has this
    Court extended the Clause that far. The second question
    is whether the congressional power to tax and spend,
    U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 1, permits the conditioning of
    a State’s continued receipt of all funds under a massive
    state-administered federal welfare program upon its ac-
    ceptance of an expansion to that program. Several of our
    opinions have suggested that the power to tax and spend
    cannot be used to coerce state administration of a federal
    program, but we have never found a law enacted under
    the spending power to be coercive. Those questions are
    difficult.
      The case is easy and straightforward, however, in an-
    other respect. What is absolutely clear, affirmed by the
    text of the 1789 Constitution, by the Tenth Amendment
    ratified in 1791, and by innumerable cases of ours in the
    220 years since, is that there are structural limits upon
    federal power—upon what it can prescribe with respect to
    private conduct, and upon what it can impose upon the
    sovereign States. Whatever may be the conceptual limits
    upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax
    and spend, they cannot be such as will enable the Federal
    Government to regulate all private conduct and to com-
    pel the States to function as administrators of federal
    programs.
      That clear principle carries the day here. The striking
    case of Wickard v. Filburn, 

[317 U.S. 111](/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/)

    
    
     (1942), which
    held that the economic activity of growing wheat, even
    for one’s own consumption, affected commerce sufficiently
    that it could be regulated, always has been regarded as
                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             3
    
           SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    the ne plus ultra of expansive Commerce Clause jurispru-
    dence. To go beyond that, and to say the failure to grow
    wheat (which is not an economic activity, or any activity
    at all) nonetheless affects commerce and therefore can be
    federally regulated, is to make mere breathing in and out
    the basis for federal prescription and to extend federal
    power to virtually all human activity.
      As for the constitutional power to tax and spend for
    the general welfare: The Court has long since expanded
    that beyond (what Madison thought it meant) taxing and
    spending for those aspects of the general welfare that were
    within the Federal Government’s enumerated powers,
    see United States v. Butler, 

[297 U.S. 1](/opinion/102580/united-states-v-butler/)

    
    
    , 65–66 (1936).
    Thus, we now have sizable federal Departments devoted
    to subjects not mentioned among Congress’ enumerated
    powers, and only marginally related to commerce: the De-
    partment of Education, the Department of Health and
    Human Services, the Department of Housing and Urban
    Development. The principal practical obstacle that pre-
    vents Congress from using the tax-and-spend power to
    assume all the general-welfare responsibilities tradition-
    ally exercised by the States is the sheer impossibility of
    managing a Federal Government large enough to adminis-
    ter such a system. That obstacle can be overcome by
    granting funds to the States, allowing them to administer
    the program. That is fair and constitutional enough when
    the States freely agree to have their powers employed and
    their employees enlisted in the federal scheme. But it is a
    blatant violation of the constitutional structure when the
    States have no choice.
      The Act before us here exceeds federal power both in
    mandating the purchase of health insurance and in deny-
    ing nonconsenting States all Medicaid funding. These
    parts of the Act are central to its design and operation,
    and all the Act’s other provisions would not have been
    enacted without them. In our view it must follow that the
    4        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    entire statute is inoperative.
                                   I
                     The Individual Mandate
       Article I, §8, of the Constitution gives Congress the
    power to “regulate Commerce . . . among the several
    States.” The Individual Mandate in the Act commands
    that every “applicable individual shall for each month
    beginning after 2013 ensure that the individual, and any
    dependent of the individual who is an applicable individ-
    ual, is covered under minimum essential coverage.” 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV). If this provision
    “regulates” anything, it is the failure to maintain mini-
    mum essential coverage. One might argue that it regu-
    lates that failure by requiring it to be accompanied by
    payment of a penalty. But that failure—that abstention
    from commerce—is not “Commerce.” To be sure, purchas-
    ing insurance is ”Commerce”; but one does not regulate
    commerce that does not exist by compelling its existence.
       In Gibbons v. Ogden, 

[9 Wheat. 1](/opinion/85412/gibbons-v-ogden/)

    
    
    , 196 (1824), Chief
    Justice Marshall wrote that the power to regulate com-
    merce is the power “to prescribe the rule by which
    commerce is to be governed.” That understanding is con-
    sistent with the original meaning of “regulate” at the time
    of the Constitution’s ratification, when “to regulate” meant
    “[t]o adjust by rule, method or established mode,” 2 N.
    Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Lan-
    guage (1828); “[t]o adjust by rule or method,” 2 S. Johnson,
    A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed. 1785); “[t]o

    (16th ed. 1777).1 It can mean to direct the manner of
    something but not to direct that something come into
    being. There is no instance in which this Court or Con-
    gress (or anyone else, to our knowledge) has used “regulate”
    in that peculiar fashion. If the word bore that meaning,
    Congress’ authority “[t]o make Rules for the Govern-
    ment and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,” U. S.
    Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 14, would have made superfluous
    the later provision for authority “[t]o raise and support
    Armies,” id., §8, cl. 12, and “[t]o provide and maintain a
    Navy,” id., §8, cl. 13.
       We do not doubt that the buying and selling of health
    insurance contracts is commerce generally subject to
    federal regulation. But when Congress provides that
    (nearly) all citizens must buy an insurance contract, it
    goes beyond “adjust[ing] by rule or method,” Johnson,
    supra, or “direct[ing] according to rule,” Ash, supra; it
    directs the creation of commerce.
       In response, the Government offers two theories as to
    why the Individual Mandate is nevertheless constitu-
    tional. Neither theory suffices to sustain its validity.
                                  A
      First, the Government submits that §5000A is “integral
    to the Affordable Care Act’s insurance reforms” and “nec-
    essary to make effective the Act’s core reforms.” Brief

    itself. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(H).
       As discussed in more detail in Part V, infra, the Act
    contains numerous health insurance reforms, but most
    notable for present purposes are the “guaranteed issue”
    and “community rating” provisions, §§300gg to 300gg–4.
    The former provides that, with a few exceptions, “each
    health insurance issuer that offers health insurance cov-
    erage in the individual or group market in a State must
    accept every employer and individual in the State that
    applies for such coverage.” §300gg–1(a). That is, an in-
    surer may not deny coverage on the basis of, among other
    things, any pre-existing medical condition that the appli-
    cant may have, and the resulting insurance must cover
    that condition. See §300gg–3.
       Under ordinary circumstances, of course, insurers would
    respond by charging high premiums to individuals with
    pre-existing conditions. The Act seeks to prevent this
    through the community-rating provision. Simply put, the
    community-rating provision requires insurers to calculate
    an individual’s insurance premium based on only four
    factors: (i) whether the individual’s plan covers just
    the individual or his family also, (ii) the “rating area” in
    which the individual lives, (iii) the individual’s age, and
    (iv) whether the individual uses tobacco. §300gg(a)(1)(A).
    Aside from the rough proxies of age and tobacco use (and
    possibly rating area), the Act does not allow an insurer to
    factor the individual’s health characteristics into the price
    of his insurance premium. This creates a new incentive
    for young and healthy individuals without pre-existing
    conditions. The insurance premiums for those in this
    group will not reflect their own low actuarial risks but will
    subsidize insurance for others in the pool. Many of them
    may decide that purchasing health insurance is not an eco-
    nomically sound decision—especially since the guaranteed-
    issue provision will enable them to purchase it at the
    same cost in later years and even if they have developed a
                       Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             7
    
            SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    pre-existing condition. But without the contribution of
    above-risk premiums from the young and healthy, the
    community-rating provision will not enable insurers to
    take on high-risk individuals without a massive increase
    in premiums.
        The Government presents the Individual Mandate as a
    unique feature of a complicated regulatory scheme govern-
    ing many parties with countervailing incentives that must
    be carefully balanced. Congress has imposed an extensive
    set of regulations on the health insurance industry, and
    compliance with those regulations will likely cost the in-
    dustry a great deal. If the industry does not respond by
    increasing premiums, it is not likely to survive. And if
    the industry does increase premiums, then there is a seri-
    ous risk that its products—insurance plans—will become
    economically undesirable for many and prohibitively ex-
    pensive for the rest.
        This is not a dilemma unique to regulation of the health-
    insurance industry.       Government regulation typically
    imposes costs on the regulated industry—especially regu-
    lation that prohibits economic behavior in which most
    market participants are already engaging, such as “piec-
    ing out” the market by selling the product to different
    classes of people at different prices (in the present context,
    providing much lower insurance rates to young and
    healthy buyers). And many industries so regulated face
    the reality that, without an artificial increase in demand,
    they cannot continue on. When Congress is regulating
    these industries directly, it enjoys the broad power to
    enact “ ‘all appropriate legislation’ ” to “ ‘protec[t]’ ” and
    “ ‘advanc[e]’ ” commerce, NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel
    Corp.,

[10 Wall. 557](/opinion/88291/the-daniel-ball/)

    
    
    , 564 (1871)). Thus, Congress might protect
    the imperiled industry by prohibiting low-cost competition,
    or by according it preferential tax treatment, or even by
    granting it a direct subsidy.

      Here, however, Congress has impressed into service
    third parties, healthy individuals who could be but are not
    customers of the relevant industry, to offset the undesir-
    able consequences of the regulation. Congress’ desire to
    force these individuals to purchase insurance is motivated
    by the fact that they are further removed from the market
    than unhealthy individuals with pre-existing conditions,
    because they are less likely to need extensive care in
    the near future. If Congress can reach out and command
    even those furthest removed from an interstate market to
    participate in the market, then the Commerce Clause
    becomes a font of unlimited power, or in Hamilton’s words,
    “the hideous monster whose devouring jaws . . . spare
    neither sex nor age, nor high nor low, nor sacred nor pro-
    fane.” The Federalist No. 33, p. 202 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).
      At the outer edge of the commerce power, this Court has
    insisted on careful scrutiny of regulations that do not
    act directly on an interstate market or its participants. In
    New York v. United States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
     (1992), we held

    these cases is that the Commerce Clause, even when sup-
    plemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause, is not
    carte blanche for doing whatever will help achieve the
    ends Congress seeks by the regulation of commerce. And
    the last two of these cases show that the scope of the
    Necessary and Proper Clause is exceeded not only when
    the congressional action directly violates the sovereignty
    of the States but also when it violates the background
    principle of enumerated (and hence limited) federal power.
       The case upon which the Government principally relies
    to sustain the Individual Mandate under the Necessary
    and Proper Clause is Gonzales v. Raich, 

[545 U.S. 1](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
     (2005).
    That case held that Congress could, in an effort to restrain
    the interstate market in marijuana, ban the local cultiva-
    tion and possession of that drug. Id., at 15–22. Raich
    is no precedent for what Congress has done here. That
    case’s prohibition of growing (cf. Wickard, 

[317 U.S. 111](/opinion/103716/wickard-v-filburn/)

    
    
    ),
    and of possession (cf. innumerable federal statutes) did not
    represent the expansion of the federal power to direct into
    a broad new field. The mandating of economic activity
    does, and since it is a field so limitless that it converts the
    Commerce Clause into a general authority to direct the
    economy, that mandating is not “consist[ent] with the
    letter and spirit of the constitution.” McCulloch v. Mary-
    land, 

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 421 (1819).
       Moreover, Raich is far different from the Individual
    Mandate in another respect. The Court’s opinion in Raich
    pointed out that the growing and possession prohibitions

     (1979).
      With the present statute, by contrast, there are many
    ways other than this unprecedented Individual Mandate
    by which the regulatory scheme’s goals of reducing insur-
    ance premiums and ensuring the profitability of insurers
    could be achieved. For instance, those who did not pur-
    chase insurance could be subjected to a surcharge when
    they do enter the health insurance system. Or they could
    be denied a full income tax credit given to those who do
    purchase the insurance.
      The Government was invited, at oral argument, to
    suggest what federal controls over private conduct (other
    than those explicitly prohibited by the Bill of Rights or
    other constitutional controls) could not be justified as
    necessary and proper for the carrying out of a general
    regulatory scheme. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27–30, 43–45
    (Mar. 27, 2012). It was unable to name any. As we said at
    the outset, whereas the precise scope of the Commerce
    Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause is uncertain,
    the proposition that the Federal Government cannot do
    everything is a fundamental precept. See Lopez, 514 U. S.,
    at 564 (“[I]f we were to accept the Government’s argu-
    ments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an in-
    dividual that Congress is without power to regulate”).
    Section 5000A is defeated by that proposition.
                                  B
      The Government’s second theory in support of the In-
    dividual Mandate is that §5000A is valid because it is
    actually a “regulat[ion of] activities having a substantial
    relation to interstate commerce, . . . i.e., . . . activities that
    substantially affect interstate commerce.” Id., at 558–559.
    See also Shreveport Rate Cases, supra. This argument

    takes a few different forms, but the basic idea is that
    §5000A regulates “the way in which individuals finance
    their participation in the health-care market.” Petitioners’
    Minimum Coverage Brief 33 (emphasis added). That is,
    the provision directs the manner in which individuals
    purchase health care services and related goods (directing
    that they be purchased through insurance) and is there-
    fore a straightforward exercise of the commerce power.
      The primary problem with this argument is that §5000A
    does not apply only to persons who purchase all, or most,
    or even any, of the health care services or goods that the
    mandated insurance covers. Indeed, the main objection
    many have to the Mandate is that they have no intention
    of purchasing most or even any of such goods or services
    and thus no need to buy insurance for those purchases.
    The Government responds that the health-care market
    involves “essentially universal participation,” id., at 35.
    The principal difficulty with this response is that it is, in
    the only relevant sense, not true. It is true enough that
    everyone consumes “health care,” if the term is taken to
    include the purchase of a bottle of aspirin. But the health
    care “market” that is the object of the Individual Mandate
    not only includes but principally consists of goods and
    services that the young people primarily affected by the
    Mandate do not purchase. They are quite simply not
    participants in that market, and cannot be made so (and
    thereby subjected to regulation) by the simple device of
    defining participants to include all those who will, later in
    their lifetime, probably purchase the goods or services
    covered by the mandated insurance.2 Such a definition of

    market participants is unprecedented, and were it to be a
    premise for the exercise of national power, it would have
    no principled limits.
       In a variation on this attempted exercise of federal
    power, the Government points out that Congress in this
    Act has purported to regulate “economic and financial
    decision[s] to forego [sic] health insurance coverage and
    [to] attempt to self-insure,” 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(A), since
    those decisions have “a substantial and deleterious effect
    on interstate commerce,” Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage
    Brief 34. But as the discussion above makes clear, the
    decision to forgo participation in an interstate market is
    not itself commercial activity (or indeed any activity at all)
    within Congress’ power to regulate. It is true that, at the
    end of the day, it is inevitable that each American will
    affect commerce and become a part of it, even if not by
    choice. But if every person comes within the Commerce
    Clause power of Congress to regulate by the simple reason
    that he will one day engage in commerce, the idea of a
    limited Government power is at an end.
       Wickard v. Filburn has been regarded as the most ex-
    pansive assertion of the commerce power in our history. A
    close second is Perez v. United States,

    involved commercial activity. To go beyond that, and to
    say that the failure to grow wheat or the refusal to make
    loans affects commerce, so that growing and lending can
    be federally compelled, is to extend federal power to virtu-
    ally everything. All of us consume food, and when we do
    so the Federal Government can prescribe what its quality
    must be and even how much we must pay. But the mere
    fact that we all consume food and are thus, sooner or later,
    participants in the “market” for food, does not empower
    the Government to say when and what we will buy. That
    is essentially what this Act seeks to do with respect to the
    purchase of health care. It exceeds federal power.
                                   C
        A few respectful responses to JUSTICE GINSBURG’s dis-
    sent on the issue of the Mandate are in order. That dis-
    sent duly recites the test of Commerce Clause power that
    our opinions have applied, but disregards the premise the
    test contains. It is true enough that Congress needs only a
    “ ‘rational basis’ for concluding that the regulated activity
    substantially affects interstate commerce,” ante, at 15 (em-
    phasis added). But it must be activity affecting com-
    merce that is regulated, and not merely the failure to
    engage in commerce. And one is not now purchasing
    the health care covered by the insurance mandate simply
    because one is likely to be purchasing it in the future. Our
    test’s premise of regulated activity is not invented out of
    whole cloth, but rests upon the Constitution’s requirement
    that it be commerce which is regulated. If all inactivity
    affecting commerce is commerce, commerce is everything.
    Ultimately the dissent is driven to saying that there is
    really no difference between action and inaction, ante, at
    26, a proposition that has never recommended itself,
    neither to the law nor to common sense. To say, for exam-
    ple, that the inaction here consists of activity in “the self-
    insurance market,” ibid., seems to us wordplay. By parity

    of reasoning the failure to buy a car can be called partici-
    pation in the non-private-car-transportation market. Com-
    merce becomes everything.
       The dissent claims that we “fai[l] to explain why the
    individual mandate threatens our constitutional order.”
    Ante, at 35. But we have done so. It threatens that order
    because it gives such an expansive meaning to the Com-
    merce Clause that all private conduct (including failure to
    act) becomes subject to federal control, effectively destroy-
    ing the Constitution’s division of governmental powers.
    Thus the dissent, on the theories proposed for the validity
    of the Mandate, would alter the accepted constitutional
    relation between the individual and the National Govern-
    ment. The dissent protests that the Necessary and Proper
    Clause has been held to include “the power to enact crimi-
    nal laws, . . . the power to imprison, . . . and the power to
    create a national bank,” ante, at 34–35. Is not the power
    to compel purchase of health insurance much lesser? No,
    not if (unlike those other dispositions) its application rests
    upon a theory that everything is within federal control
    simply because it exists.
       The dissent’s exposition of the wonderful things the Fed-
    eral Government has achieved through exercise of its
    assigned powers, such as “the provision of old-age and
    survivors’ benefits” in the Social Security Act, ante, at 2,
    is quite beside the point. The issue here is whether the
    federal government can impose the Individual Mandate
    through the Commerce Clause. And the relevant history
    is not that Congress has achieved wide and wonderful
    results through the proper exercise of its assigned powers
    in the past, but that it has never before used the Com-
    merce Clause to compel entry into commerce.3 The dissent

    treats the Constitution as though it is an enumeration of
    those problems that the Federal Government can ad-
    dress—among which, it finds, is “the Nation’s course in
    the economic and social welfare realm,” ibid., and more
    specifically “the problem of the uninsured,” ante, at 7.
    The Constitution is not that. It enumerates not federally
    soluble problems, but federally available powers. The
    Federal Government can address whatever problems it
    wants but can bring to their solution only those powers
    that the Constitution confers, among which is the power to
    regulate commerce. None of our cases say anything else.
    Article I contains no whatever-it-takes-to-solve-a-national-
    problem power.
      The dissent dismisses the conclusion that the power to
    compel entry into the health-insurance market would
    include the power to compel entry into the new-car or
    broccoli markets. The latter purchasers, it says, “will be

    demonstrate “Congress’ authority under the commerce power to compel

    Wrong on both scores. As its name suggests, the condemnation power
    does not “compel” anyone to do anything. It acts in rem, against the
    property that is condemned, and is effective with or without a transfer
    of title from the former owner. More important, the power to condemn
    for public use is a separate sovereign power, explicitly acknowledged in
    the Fifth Amendment, which provides that “private property [shall not]
    be taken for public use, without just compensation.”
      Thus, the power to condemn tends to refute rather than support
    the power to compel purchase of unwanted goods at a prescribed price:
    The latter is rather like the power to condemn cash for public use. If it
    existed, why would it not (like the condemnation power) be accompa-
    nied by a requirement of fair compensation for the portion of the
    exacted price that exceeds the goods’ fair market value (here, the
    difference between what the free market would charge for a health-
    insurance policy on a young, healthy person with no pre-existing
    conditions, and the government-exacted community-rated premium)?

    or nourishment,” whereas those refusing to purchase
    health-insurance will ultimately get treated anyway, at
    others’ expense. Ante, at 21. “[T]he unique attributes of
    the health-care market . . . give rise to a significant free-
    riding problem that does not occur in other markets.”
    Ante, at 28. And “a vegetable-purchase mandate” (or a
    car-purchase mandate) is not “likely to have a substantial
    effect on the health-care costs” borne by other Americans.
    Ante, at 29. Those differences make a very good argument
    by the dissent’s own lights, since they show that the fail-
    ure to purchase health insurance, unlike the failure to
    purchase cars or broccoli, creates a national, social-welfare
    problem that is (in the dissent’s view) included among the
    unenumerated “problems” that the Constitution author-
    izes the Federal Government to solve. But those differences
    do not show that the failure to enter the health-insurance
    market, unlike the failure to buy cars and broccoli, is
    an activity that Congress can “regulate.” (Of course one
    day the failure of some of the public to purchase Amer-
    ican cars may endanger the existence of domestic automo-
    bile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli
    may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered cancer-
    fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing
    health-care costs that are a burden on the rest of us—in
    which case, under the theory of JUSTICE GINSBURG’s dis-
    sent, moving against those inactivities will also come
    within the Federal Government’s unenumerated problem-
    solving powers.)

                         The Taxing Power
      As far as §5000A is concerned, we would stop there.
    Congress has attempted to regulate beyond the scope of its

    Commerce Clause authority,4 and §5000A is therefore
    invalid. The Government contends, however, as expressed
    in the caption to Part II of its brief, that “THE MINIMUM
    COVERAGE PROVISION IS INDEPENDENTLY AUTHORIZED BY
    CONGRESS’S TAXING POWER.” Petitioners’ Minimum Cov-
    erage Brief 52. The phrase “independently authorized”
    suggests the existence of a creature never hitherto seen
    in the United States Reports: A penalty for constitutional
    purposes that is also a tax for constitutional purposes. In
    all our cases the two are mutually exclusive. The provi-
    sion challenged under the Constitution is either a penalty
    or else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a regu-
    latory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been
    imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was im-
    posed as a tax upon permissible action could have been a
    regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know
    of no case, and the Government cites none, in which the
    imposition was, for constitutional purposes, both.5 The
    two are mutually exclusive. Thus, what the Government’s
    caption should have read was “ALTERNATIVELY, THE
    MINIMUM COVERAGE PROVISION IS NOT A MANDATE-WITH-
    PENALTY BUT A TAX.” It is important to bear this in mind
    in evaluating the tax argument of the Government and of
    those who support it: The issue is not whether Congress

      4 No   one seriously contends that any of Congress’ other enumerated
    powers gives it the authority to enact §5000A as a regulation.
       5 Of course it can be both for statutory purposes, since Congress can
    
    define “tax” and “penalty” in its enactments any way it wishes. That is
    why United States v. Sotelo, 

[436 U.S. 268](/opinion/109864/united-states-v-sotelo/)

    
    
     (1978), does not disprove our
    statement. That case held that a “penalty” for willful failure to pay
    one’s taxes was included among the “taxes” made non-dischargeable
    under the Bankruptcy Code. 436 U. S., at 273–275. Whether the
    “penalty” was a “tax” within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code had
    absolutely no bearing on whether it escaped the constitutional limita-
    tions on penalties.

    had the power to frame the minimum-coverage provision

    provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-with-penalty,
    since that would render it constitutional rather than un-
    constitutional (ut res magis valeat quam pereat). But we
    cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is not. “ ‘ “[A]l-

       So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction
    here is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestion-
    ably is. The minimum-coverage provision is found in 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A, entitled “Requirement to maintain mini-
    mum essential coverage.” (Emphasis added.) It commands
    that every “applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the
    individual . . . is covered under minimum essential cover-
    age.” Ibid. (emphasis added). And the immediately fol-
    lowing provision states that, “[i]f . . . an applicable
    individual . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection
    (a) . . . there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.” §5000A(b)
    (emphasis added). And several of Congress’ legislative
    “findings” with regard to §5000A confirm that it sets forth
    a legal requirement and constitutes the assertion of regu-
    latory power, not mere taxing power. See 

42 U.S. C

    §18091(2)(A) (“The requirement regulates activity . . .”);

    “shall” could be construed to mean “may,” but rather that
    this preliminary provision could not impose upon the oper-
    ative provisions of the Act a mandate that they did not
    contain: “We . . . decline petitioners’ invitation to con-
    strue §2021c(a)(1)(A), alone and in isolation, as a com-
    mand to the States independent of the remainder of the
    Act.” New York, 505 U. S., at 170. Our opinion then
    proceeded to “consider each [of the three operative provi-
    sions] in turn.” Ibid. Here the mandate—the “shall”—is
    contained not in an inoperative preliminary recital, but in
    the dispositive operative provision itself. New York pro-
    vides no support for reading it to be permissive.

    for failure to buy insurance is alone sufficient to render
    that failure unlawful. It is one of the canons of interpreta-
    tion that a statute that penalizes an act makes it unlaw-
    ful: “[W]here the statute inflicts a penalty for doing an act,
    although the act itself is not expressly prohibited, yet to do
    the act is unlawful, because it cannot be supposed that the
    Legislature intended that a penalty should be inflicted for
    a lawful act.” Powhatan Steamboat Co. v. Appomattox R.

        We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed
    for violation of the law, and so too, we never have classi-
    fied as a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself
    as a penalty. To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a
    tax a statutory exaction (imposed for something other
    than a violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that
    does not entail the significant constitutional consequences

     (1867)) or “surcharge” (New York v. United States,
    supra.). But we have never—never—treated as a tax an
    exaction which faces up to the critical difference between
    a tax and a penalty, and explicitly denominates the exac-
    tion a “penalty.” Eighteen times in §5000A itself and else-
    where throughout the Act, Congress called the exaction in
    §5000A(b) a “penalty.”
       That §5000A imposes not a simple tax but a mandate to
    which a penalty is attached is demonstrated by the fact
    that some are exempt from the tax who are not ex-
    empt from the mandate—a distinction that would make
    no sense if the mandate were not a mandate. Section
    5000A(d) exempts three classes of people from the defini-
    tion of “applicable individual” subject to the minimum
    coverage requirement: Those with religious objections or
    who participate in a “health care sharing ministry,”
    §5000A(d)(2); those who are “not lawfully present” in the
    United States, §5000A(d)(3); and those who are incarcer-
    ated, §5000A(d)(4). Section 5000A(e) then creates a sepa-
    rate set of exemptions, excusing from liability for the
    penalty certain individuals who are subject to the mini-
    mum coverage requirement: Those who cannot afford
    coverage, §5000A(e)(1); who earn too little income to re-
    quire filing a tax return, §5000A(e)(2); who are members
    of an Indian tribe, §5000A(e)(3); who experience only short
    gaps in coverage, §5000A(e)(4); and who, in the judgment
    of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, “have
    suffered a hardship with respect to the capability to obtain
    coverage,” §5000A(e)(5). If §5000A were a tax, these two
    classes of exemption would make no sense; there being no
    requirement, all the exemptions would attach to the pen-
    alty (renamed tax) alone.
       In the face of all these indications of a regulatory re-
    quirement accompanied by a penalty, the Solicitor General
    assures us that “neither the Treasury Department nor the

    Department of Health and Human Services interprets
    Section 5000A as imposing a legal obligation,” Petitioners’
    Minimum Coverage Brief 61, and that “[i]f [those subject
    to the Act] pay the tax penalty, they’re in compliance with
    the law,” Tr. of Oral Arg. 50 (Mar. 26, 2012). These self-
    serving litigating positions are entitled to no weight.
    What counts is what the statute says, and that is entirely
    clear. It is worth noting, moreover, that these assurances
    contradict the Government’s position in related litigation.
    Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the
    Commonwealth of Virginia enacted Va. Code Ann. §38.2–
    3430.1:1 (Lexis Supp. 2011), which states, “No resident of
    [the] Commonwealth . . . shall be required to obtain or
    maintain a policy of individual insurance coverage except
    as required by a court or the Department of Social Ser-
    vices . . . .” In opposing Virginia’s assertion of standing to
    challenge §5000A based on this statute, the Government
    said that “if the minimum coverage provision is unconsti-
    tutional, the [Virginia] statute is unnecessary, and if the
    minimum coverage provision is upheld, the state statute is
    void under the Supremacy Clause.” Brief for Appellant
    in No. 11–1057 etc. (CA4), p. 29. But it would be void
    under the Supremacy Clause only if it was contradicted by
    a federal “require[ment] to obtain or maintain a policy of
    individual insurance coverage.”
      Against the mountain of evidence that the minimum
    coverage requirement is what the statute calls it—a re-
    quirement—and that the penalty for its violation is what
    the statute calls it—a penalty—the Government brings
    forward the flimsiest of indications to the contrary. It
    notes that “[t]he minimum coverage provision amends the
    Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non-exempted
    individual . . . will owe a monetary penalty, in addition to
    the income tax itself,” and that “[t]he [Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS)] will assess and collect the penalty in the
    same manner as assessable penalties under the Internal

    The manner of collection could perhaps suggest a tax if
    IRS penalty-collection were unheard-of or rare. It is not.
    See, e.g.,

    . §527(j) (2006 ed.) (IRS-collectible pen-
    alty for failure to make campaign-finance disclosures);
    §5761(c) (IRS-collectible penalty for domestic sales of to-
    bacco products labeled for export); §9707 (IRS-collectible

    premium payments on behalf of mining employees). In

    , we held that an exaction not only enforced by the
    Commissioner of Internal Revenue but even called a “tax”
    was in fact a penalty. “[I]f the concept of penalty means
    anything,” we said, “it means punishment for an unlawful
    act or omission.” Id., at 224. See also Lipke v. Lederer,
    

[259 U.S. 557](/opinion/100025/lipke-v-lederer/)

    
    
     (1922) (same). Moreover, while the penalty
    is assessed and collected by the IRS, §5000A is adminis-
    tered both by that agency and by the Department of
    Health and Human Services (and also the Secretary of
    Veteran Affairs), see §5000A(e)(1)(D), (e)(5), (f)(1)(A)(v),
    (f)(1)(E) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), which is responsible for
    defining its substantive scope—a feature that would be
    quite extraordinary for taxes.
       The Government points out that “[t]he amount of the
    penalty will be calculated as a percentage of household
    income for federal income tax purposes, subject to a floor
    and [a] ca[p],” and that individuals who earn so little
    money that they “are not required to file income tax re-
    turns for the taxable year are not subject to the penalty”
    (though they are, as we discussed earlier, subject to the
    mandate). Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage Brief 12, 53.
    But varying a penalty according to ability to pay is an
    utterly familiar practice. See, e.g., 

33 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1319(d)

      The last of the feeble arguments in favor of petition-
    ers that we will address is the contention that what this
    statute repeatedly calls a penalty is in fact a tax because it
    contains no scienter requirement. The presence of such a
    requirement suggests a penalty—though one can imagine
    a tax imposed only on willful action; but the absence of
    such a requirement does not suggest a tax. Penalties for
    absolute-liability offenses are commonplace. And where a
    statute is silent as to scienter, we traditionally presume
    a mens rea requirement if the statute imposes a “severe
    penalty.” Staples v. United States, 

[511 U.S. 600](/opinion/1087954/staples-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 618
    (1994). Since we have an entire jurisprudence addressing
    when it is that a scienter requirement should be inferred
    from a penalty, it is quite illogical to suggest that a
    penalty is not a penalty for want of an express scienter
    requirement.
      And the nail in the coffin is that the mandate and pen-
    alty are located in Title I of the Act, its operative core,
    rather than where a tax would be found—in Title IX,
    containing the Act’s “Revenue Provisions.” In sum, “the
    terms of [the] act rende[r] it unavoidable,” Parsons v.
    Bedford, 

[3 Pet. 433](/opinion/85684/parsons-v-bedford/)

    
    
    , 448 (1830), that Congress imposed a
    regulatory penalty, not a tax.
      For all these reasons, to say that the Individual Man-
    date merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute
    but to rewrite it. Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubl-
    ing. Taxes have never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act
    of 1765, and in part for that reason, the Constitution
    requires tax increases to originate in the House of Repre-
    sentatives. See Art. I, §7, cl. 1. That is to say, they must
    originate in the legislative body most accountable to the

    people, where legislators must weigh the need for the tax
    against the terrible price they might pay at their next
    election, which is never more than two years off. The
    Federalist No. 58 “defend[ed] the decision to give the
    origination power to the House on the ground that the
    Chamber that is more accountable to the people should
    have the primary role in raising revenue.” United States
    v. Munoz-Flores, 

[495 U.S. 385](/opinion/112427/united-states-v-munoz-flores/)

    
    
    , 395 (1990). We have no
    doubt that Congress knew precisely what it was doing
    when it rejected an earlier version of this legislation that
    imposed a tax instead of a requirement-with-penalty. See
    Affordable Health Care for America Act, H. R. 3962, 111th
    Cong., 1st Sess., §501 (2009); America’s Healthy Future
    Act of 2009, S. 1796, 111th Cong., 1st Sess., §1301. Impos-
    ing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitu-
    tional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of
    government least accountable to the citizenry.
       Finally, we must observe that rewriting §5000A as a tax
    in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to
    confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is
    a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States
    according to their population. Art. I, §9, cl. 4. Perhaps it
    is not (we have no need to address the point); but the
    meaning of the Direct Tax Clause is famously unclear, and
    its application here is a question of first impression that
    deserves more thoughtful consideration than the lick-and-
    a-promise accorded by the Government and its supporters.
    The Government’s opening brief did not even address the
    question—perhaps because, until today, no federal court
    has accepted the implausible argument that §5000A is
    an exercise of the tax power. And once respondents raised
    the issue, the Government devoted a mere 21 lines of its
    reply brief to the issue. Petitioners’ Minimum Coverage

                                 III
                     The Anti-Injunction Act
      There is another point related to the Individual Man-
    date that we must discuss—a point that logically should
    have been discussed first: Whether jurisdiction over the
    challenges to the minimum-coverage provision is precluded
    by the Anti-Injunction Act, which provides that “no suit
    for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection
    of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any per-
    son,” 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §7421(a) (2006 ed.).
      We have left the question to this point because it
    seemed to us that the dispositive question whether the
    minimum-coverage provision is a tax is more appropriately
    addressed in the significant constitutional context of
    whether it is an exercise of Congress’ taxing power. Hav-
    ing found that it is not, we have no difficulty in deciding
    that these suits do not have “the purpose of restraining
    the assessment or collection of any tax.”6
    ——————
      6 The amicus appointed to defend the proposition that the Anti-
    
    Injunction Act deprives us of jurisdiction stresses that the penalty for
    failing to comply with the mandate “shall be assessed and collected
    in the same manner as an assessable penalty under subchapter B of
    chapter 68,” 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(g)(1) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and that
    such penalties “shall be assessed and collected in the same manner
    as taxes,” §6671(a) (2006 ed.). But that point seems to us to confirm
    the inapplicability of the Anti-Injunction Act. That the penalty is to
    be “assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes” refutes the
    proposition that it is a tax for all statutory purposes, including with
    respect to the Anti-Injunction Act. Moreover, elsewhere in the Internal
    Revenue Code, Congress has provided both that a particular payment
    shall be “assessed and collected” in the same manner as a tax and that
    no suit shall be maintained to restrain the assessment or collection of
    the payment. See, e.g., §§7421(b)(1), §6901(a); §6305(a), (b). The

       The Government and those who support its position on
    this point make the remarkable argument that §5000A is
    not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, see Brief
    for Petitioners in No. 11–398 (Anti-Injunction Act), but
    is a tax for constitutional purposes, see Petitioners’ Mini-
    mum Coverage Brief 52–62. The rhetorical device that
    tries to cloak this argument in superficial plausibility is
    the same device employed in arguing that for constitu-
    tional purposes the minimum-coverage provision is a tax:
    confusing the question of what Congress did with the
    question of what Congress could have done. What quali-
    fies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, unlike
    what qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Constitution, is
    entirely within the control of Congress. Compare Bailey v.
    George,

    Law), with Child Labor Tax Case, 259 U. S., at 36–41
    (holding the same law unconstitutional as exceeding Con-
    gress’ taxing power). Congress could have defined “tax”
    for purposes of that statute in such fashion as to exclude
    some exactions that in fact are “taxes.” It might have
    prescribed, for example, that a particular exercise of the
    taxing power “shall not be regarded as a tax for purposes
    of the Anti-Injunction Act.” But there is no such prescrip-
    tion here. What the Government would have us believe in
    
    ——————
    latter directive would be superfluous if the former invoked the Anti-
    Injunction Act.
      Amicus also suggests that the penalty should be treated as a tax
    because it is an assessable penalty, and the Code’s assessment provi-
    sion authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to assess “all taxes (in-
    cluding interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and as-
    sessable penalties) imposed by this title.” §6201(a) (2006 ed., Supp.
    IV). But the fact that such items are included as “taxes” for purposes of
    assessment does not establish that they are included as “taxes” for
    purposes of other sections of the Code, such as the Anti-Injunction Act,
    that do not contain similar “including” language.

    these cases is that the very same textual indications that
    show this is not a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act show
    that it is a tax under the Constitution. That carries ver-
    bal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of the
    sophists.
                                 IV
                     The Medicaid Expansion
      We now consider respondents’ second challenge to the
    constitutionality of the ACA, namely, that the Act’s dra-
    matic expansion of the Medicaid program exceeds Con-
    gress’ power to attach conditions to federal grants to the
    States.
      The ACA does not legally compel the States to partici-
    pate in the expanded Medicaid program, but the Act au-
    thorizes a severe sanction for any State that refuses to go
    along: termination of all the State’s Medicaid funding. For
    the average State, the annual federal Medicaid subsidy is
    equal to more than one-fifth of the State’s expenditures.7
    A State forced out of the program would not only lose this
    huge sum but would almost certainly find it necessary to
    increase its own health-care expenditures substantially,
    requiring either a drastic reduction in funding for other
    programs or a large increase in state taxes. And these
    new taxes would come on top of the federal taxes already
    paid by the State’s citizens to fund the Medicaid program
    in other States.
      The States challenging the constitutionality of the ACA’s
    Medicaid Expansion contend that, for these practical
    reasons, the Act really does not give them any choice at
    all. As proof of this, they point to the goal and the struc-

    ture of the ACA. The goal of the Act is to provide near-
    universal medical coverage, 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(D), and
    without 100% State participation in the Medicaid pro-
    gram, attainment of this goal would be thwarted. Even if
    States could elect to remain in the old Medicaid program,
    while declining to participate in the Expansion, there
    would be a gaping hole in coverage. And if a substantial
    number of States were entirely expelled from the program,
    the number of persons without coverage would be even
    higher.
       In light of the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage,
    petitioners argue, if Congress had thought that anything
    less than 100% state participation was a realistic possibil-
    ity, Congress would have provided a backup scheme. But
    no such scheme is to be found anywhere in the more than
    900 pages of the Act. This shows, they maintain, that
    Congress was certain that the ACA’s Medicaid offer was
    one that no State could refuse.
       In response to this argument, the Government contends
    that any congressional assumption about uniform state
    participation was based on the simple fact that the offer
    of federal funds associated with the expanded coverage is
    such a generous gift that no State would want to turn it
    down.
       To evaluate these arguments, we consider the extent of
    the Federal Government’s power to spend money and to
    attach conditions to money granted to the States.
                                  A
        No one has ever doubted that the Constitution author-
    izes the Federal Government to spend money, but for
    many years the scope of this power was unsettled. The
    Constitution grants Congress the power to collect taxes “to
    . . . provide for the . . . general Welfare of the United
    States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 1, and from “the foundation of the
    Nation sharp differences of opinion have persisted as to

    the true interpretation of the phrase” “the general wel-
    fare.” Butler, 297 U. S., at 65. Madison, it has been said,
    thought that the phrase “amounted to no more than a
    reference to the other powers enumerated in the subse-
    quent clauses of the same section,” while Hamilton “main-
    tained the clause confers a power separate and distinct
    from those later enumerated [and] is not restricted in
    meaning by the grant of them.” Ibid.
      The Court resolved this dispute in Butler. Writing for
    the Court, Justice Roberts opined that the Madisonian
    view would make Article I’s grant of the spending power a
    “mere tautology.” Ibid. To avoid that, he adopted Hamil-
    ton’s approach and found that “the power of Congress to
    authorize expenditure of public moneys for public pur-
    poses is not limited by the direct grants of legislative
    power found in the Constitution.” Id., at 66. Instead, he
    wrote, the spending power’s “confines are set in the clause
    which confers it, and not in those of section 8 which be-
    stow and define the legislative powers of the Congress.”

      The power to make any expenditure that furthers “the
    general welfare” is obviously very broad, and shortly after
    Butler was decided the Court gave Congress wide leeway
    to decide whether an expenditure qualifies. See Helvering,
    301 U. S., at 640–641. “The discretion belongs to Con-
    gress,” the Court wrote, “unless the choice is clearly
    wrong, a display of arbitrary power, not an exercise of
    judgment.” Id., at 640. Since that time, the Court has
    never held that a federal expenditure was not for “the
    general welfare.”

       When Congress makes grants to the States, it customar-
    ily attaches conditions, and this Court has long held that
    the Constitution generally permits Congress to do this.

    greatly increases federal power. “[O]bjectives not thought
    to be within Article I’s enumerated legislative fields, may
    nevertheless be attained through the use of the spending
    power and the conditional grant of federal funds.” Dole,

    (by attaching conditions to federal funds, Congress may
    induce the States to “tak[e] certain actions that Congress
    could not require them to take”).
       This formidable power, if not checked in any way, would
    present a grave threat to the system of federalism created
    by our Constitution. If Congress’ “Spending Clause power
    to pursue objectives outside of Article I’s enumerated

    quotation marks omitted), is “limited only by Congress’
    notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast
    financial resources of the Federal Government, is that
    the Spending Clause gives ‘power to the Congress to tear
    down the barriers, to invade the states’ jurisdiction, and to
    become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no
    restrictions save such as are self-imposed,’ ” Dole, supra, at
    217 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (quoting Butler, 297 U. S.,
    at 78). “[T]he Spending Clause power, if wielded without
    concern for the federal balance, has the potential to oblite-
    rate distinctions between national and local spheres of
    interest and power by permitting the Federal Government
    to set policy in the most sensitive areas of traditional
    state concern, areas which otherwise would lie outside
    its reach.” Davis, supra, at 654–655 (KENNEDY, J.,
    dissenting).
       Recognizing this potential for abuse, our cases have long
    held that the power to attach conditions to grants to the
    States has limits. See, e.g., Dole, supra, at 207–208; id.,
    at 207 (spending power is “subject to several general re-

    strictions articulated in our cases”). For one thing, any
    such conditions must be unambiguous so that a State at
    least knows what it is getting into. See Pennhurst, supra,
    at 17. Conditions must also be related “to the federal
    interest in particular national projects or programs,”
    Massachusetts v. United States, 

[435 U.S. 444](/opinion/109824/massachusetts-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 461 (1978),
    and the conditional grant of federal funds may not “induce
    the States to engage in activities that would themselves be
    unconstitutional,” Dole, supra, at 210; see Lawrence County

    , 269–270 (1985). Finally, while Congress may seek to
    induce States to accept conditional grants, Congress may
    not cross the “point at which pressure turns into compul-
    sion, and ceases to be inducement.” Steward Machine, 301
    U. S., at 590. Accord, College Savings Bank, supra, at 687;

       When federal legislation gives the States a real choice
    whether to accept or decline a federal aid package, the
    federal-state relationship is in the nature of a contractual
    relationship. See Barnes v. Gorman, 

[536 U.S. 181](/opinion/121152/barnes-v-gorman/)

    
    
    , 186
    (2002); Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 17. And just as a contract
    is voidable if coerced, “[t]he legitimacy of Congress’ power
    to legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether
    the State voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms
    of the ‘contract.’ ” Ibid. (emphasis added). If a federal
    spending program coerces participation the States have
    not “exercise[d] their choice”—let alone made an “informed
    choice.” Id., at 17, 25.
       Coercing States to accept conditions risks the destruc-
    tion of the “unique role of the States in our system.”
    Davis, supra, at 685 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). “[T]he
    Constitution has never been understood to confer upon
    Congress the ability to require the States to govern accord-
    ing to Congress’ instructions.” New York, 505 U. S., at

    162. Congress may not “simply commandeer the legisla-
    tive processes of the States by directly compelling them to
    enact and enforce a federal regulatory program.” Id.,
    at 161 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).
    Congress effectively engages in this impermissible com-
    pulsion when state participation in a federal spending
    program is coerced, so that the States’ choice whether to
    enact or administer a federal regulatory program is ren-
    dered illusory.
       Where all Congress has done is to “encourag[e] state
    regulation rather than compe[l] it, state governments
    remain responsive to the local electorate’s preferences;
    state officials remain accountable to the people. [But]
    where the Federal Government compels States to regulate,
    the accountability of both state and federal officials is
    diminished.” New York, supra, at 168.
       Amici who support the Government argue that forcing
    state employees to implement a federal program is more
    respectful of federalism than using federal workers to
    implement that program. See, e.g., Brief for Service Em-
    ployees International Union et al. as Amici Curiae in No.
    11–398, pp. 25–26. They note that Congress, instead of
    expanding Medicaid, could have established an entirely
    federal program to provide coverage for the same group of
    people. By choosing to structure Medicaid as a cooperative
    federal-state program, they contend, Congress allows for
    more state control. Ibid.
       This argument reflects a view of federalism that our
    cases have rejected—and with good reason. When Con-
    gress compels the States to do its bidding, it blurs the
    lines of political accountability. If the Federal Govern-
    ment makes a controversial decision while acting on its
    own, “it is the Federal Government that makes the deci-
    sion in full view of the public, and it will be federal offi-
    cials that suffer the consequences if the decision turns out
    to be detrimental or unpopular.” New York, 505 U. S., at

    168. But when the Federal Government compels the
    States to take unpopular actions, “it may be state officials
    who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the
    federal officials who devised the regulatory program may
    remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their
    decision.” Id., at 169; see Printz, supra, at 930. For this
    reason, federal officeholders may view this “departur[e]
    from the federal structure to be in their personal interests
    . . . as a means of shifting responsibility for the eventual
    decision.” New York, 505 U. S., at 182–183. And even state
    officials may favor such a “departure from the constitu-
    tional plan,” since uncertainty concerning responsibility
    may also permit them to escape accountability. Id., at
    182. If a program is popular, state officials may claim
    credit; if it is unpopular, they may protest that they were
    merely responding to a federal directive.
        Once it is recognized that spending-power legislation
    cannot coerce state participation, two questions remain:
    (1) What is the meaning of coercion in this context? (2) Is
    the ACA’s expanded Medicaid coverage coercive? We now
    turn to those questions.
                                  D
                                  1
      The answer to the first of these questions—the meaning
    of coercion in the present context—is straightforward. As
    we have explained, the legitimacy of attaching conditions
    to federal grants to the States depends on the voluntari-
    ness of the States’ choice to accept or decline the offered
    package. Therefore, if States really have no choice other
    than to accept the package, the offer is coercive, and the
    conditions cannot be sustained under the spending power.
    And as our decision in South Dakota v. Dole makes clear,
    theoretical voluntariness is not enough.
      In South Dakota v. Dole, we considered whether the
    spending power permitted Congress to condition 5% of the
    36      NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    State’s federal highway funds on the State’s adoption of
    a minimum drinking age of 21 years. South Dakota ar-
    gued that the program was impermissibly coercive, but we
    disagreed, reasoning that “Congress ha[d] directed only
    that a State desiring to establish a minimum drinking age
    lower than 21 lose a relatively small percentage of certain
    federal highway funds.” 483 U. S., at 211. Because “all
    South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen
    course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5%
    of the funds otherwise obtainable under specified high-
    way grant programs,” we found that “Congress ha[d] of-
    fered relatively mild encouragement to the States to enact
    higher minimum drinking ages than they would otherwise
    choose.” Ibid. Thus, the decision whether to comply with
    the federal condition “remain[ed] the prerogative of the
    States not merely in theory but in fact,” and so the pro-
    gram at issue did not exceed Congress’ power. Id., at 211–
    212 (emphasis added).
      The question whether a law enacted under the spending
    power is coercive in fact will sometimes be difficult, but
    where Congress has plainly “crossed the line distinguish-
    ing encouragement from coercion,” New York, supra, at
    175, a federal program that coopts the States’ political
    processes must be declared unconstitutional. “[T]he fed-
    eral balance is too essential a part of our constitutional
    structure and plays too vital a role in securing freedom for
    us to admit inability to intervene.” Lopez, 514 U. S., at
    578 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).
                                  2
       The Federal Government’s argument in this case at best
    pays lip service to the anticoercion principle. The Federal
    Government suggests that it is sufficient if States are
    “free, as a matter of law, to turn down” federal funds.

    ernment, neither the amount of the offered federal funds
    nor the amount of the federal taxes extracted from the
    taxpayers of a State to pay for the program in question is
    relevant in determining whether there is impermissible
    coercion. Id., at 41–46.
       This argument ignores reality. When a heavy federal
    tax is levied to support a federal program that offers large
    grants to the States, States may, as a practical matter, be
    unable to refuse to participate in the federal program and
    to substitute a state alternative. Even if a State believes
    that the federal program is ineffective and inefficient,
    withdrawal would likely force the State to impose a huge
    tax increase on its residents, and this new state tax would
    come on top of the federal taxes already paid by residents
    to support subsidies to participating States.13
       Acceptance of the Federal Government’s interpreta-
    tion of the anticoercion rule would permit Congress to dic-
    tate policy in areas traditionally governed primarily at the
    state or local level. Suppose, for example, that Congress
    enacted legislation offering each State a grant equal to the
    State’s entire annual expenditures for primary and sec-
    ondary education. Suppose also that this funding came
    with conditions governing such things as school curricu-
    lum, the hiring and tenure of teachers, the drawing of
    school districts, the length and hours of the school day, the

    money its residents pay in federal taxes.” Ante, at 59, n. 26. This is
    true as a formal matter. “When the United States Government taxes
    United States citizens, it taxes them ‘in their individual capacities’ as
    ‘the people of America’—not as residents of a particular State.” Ante, at

    down that offer, but if it did so, its residents would not
    only be required to pay the federal taxes needed to support
    this expensive new program, but they would also be forced
    to pay an equivalent amount in state taxes. And if the
    State gave in to the federal law, the State and its subdivi-
    sions would surrender their traditional authority in the
    field of education. Asked at oral argument whether such
    a law would be allowed under the spending power, the
    Solicitor General responded that it would. Tr. of Oral Arg.

      Whether federal spending legislation crosses the line
    from enticement to coercion is often difficult to determine,
    and courts should not conclude that legislation is uncon-
    stitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an
    offer is unmistakably clear. In this case, however, there
    can be no doubt. In structuring the ACA, Congress unam-
    biguously signaled its belief that every State would have
    no real choice but to go along with the Medicaid Expan-
    sion. If the anticoercion rule does not apply in this case,
    then there is no such rule.
                                   1
       The dimensions of the Medicaid program lend strong
    support to the petitioner States’ argument that refusing to
    accede to the conditions set out in the ACA is not a realis-
    tic option. Before the ACA’s enactment, Medicaid funded
    medical care for pregnant women, families with depend-
    ents, children, the blind, the elderly, and the disabled. See

       Medicaid has long been the largest federal program of

    on Medicaid. According to the Office of Management and Budget,
    federal grants to the States for Medicaid amounted to nearly $273
    billion in Fiscal Year 2010. See Office of Management and Bud-

    www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals. In that Fiscal Year, total
    federal outlays for grants to state and local governments amounted to
    over $608 billion, see Table 12.1, and state and local government
    expenditures from their own sources amounted to $1.6 trillion, see
    Table 15.2. Using these numbers, 44.8% of all federal outlays to both
    state and local governments was allocated to Medicaid, amounting to
    16.8% of all state and local expenditures from their own sources.

    Brief for Sen. Harry Reid et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 11–
    400, p. 21 (“States may always choose to decrease expendi-
    tures on other programs or to raise revenues”). But the
    sheer size of this federal spending program in relation to
    state expenditures means that a State would be very hard
    pressed to compensate for the loss of federal funds by
    cutting other spending or raising additional revenue.
    Arizona, for example, commits 12% of its state expendi-
    tures to Medicaid, and relies on the Federal Government
    to provide the rest: $5.6 billion, equaling roughly one-third
    of Arizona’s annual state expenditures of $17 billion. See
    NASBO Report 7, 47. Therefore, if Arizona lost federal
    Medicaid funding, the State would have to commit an
    additional 33% of all its state expenditures to fund an
    equivalent state program along the lines of pre-expansion
    Medicaid. This means that the State would have to allo-
    cate 45% of its annual expenditures for that one purpose.

    funding item is aid to support elementary and secondary
    education, which amounts to 12.8% of total federal outlays
    to the States, see id., at 7, 16, and equals only 6.6% of
    all state expenditures combined. See ibid. In Arizona,
    for example, although federal Medicaid expenditures are
    equal to 33% of all state expenditures, federal education
    funds amount to only 9.8% of all state expenditures. See
    ibid. And even in States with less than average federal
    Medicaid funding, that funding is at least twice the size of
    federal education funding as a percentage of state expend-
    itures. Id., at 7, 16, 47.
       A State forced out of the Medicaid program would face
    burdens in addition to the loss of federal Medicaid fund-
    ing. For example, a nonparticipating State might be found
    to be ineligible for other major federal funding sources,
    such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF),
    which is premised on the expectation that States will
    participate in Medicaid. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §602(a)(3) (2006
    ed.) (requiring that certain beneficiaries of TANF funds be
    “eligible for medical assistance under the State[’s Medi-
    caid] plan”). And withdrawal or expulsion from the Medi-
    caid program would not relieve a State’s hospitals of their
    obligation under federal law to provide care for patients
    who are unable to pay for medical services. The Emer-
    gency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, §1395dd,
    requires hospitals that receive any federal funding to
    provide stabilization care for indigent patients but does
    not offer federal funding to assist facilities in carrying out
    its mandate. Many of these patients are now covered by
    Medicaid. If providers could not look to the Medicaid
    program to pay for this care, they would find it exceed-
    ingly difficult to comply with federal law unless they were
    given substantial state support. See, e.g., Brief for Econ-
    omists as Amici Curiae in No 11–400, p. 11.
       For these reasons, the offer that the ACA makes to the
    States—go along with a dramatic expansion of Medicaid or

    potentially lose all federal Medicaid funding—is quite
    unlike anything that we have seen in a prior spending-
    power case. In South Dakota v. Dole, the total amount
    that the States would have lost if every single State
    had refused to comply with the 21-year-old drinking
    age was approximately $614.7 million—or about 0.19%
    of all state expenditures combined.       See Nat. Assn.
    of State Budget Officers, 1989 (Fiscal Years 1987–
    1989 Data) State Expenditure Report 10, 84 (1989),
    http://www.nasbo.org/publications-data/state-expenditure-
    report/archives. South Dakota stood to lose, at most,
    funding that amounted to less than 1% of its annual state
    expenditures. See ibid. Under the ACA, by contrast, the
    Federal Government has threatened to withhold 42.3% of
    all federal outlays to the states, or approximately $233
    billion. See NASBO Report 7, 10, 47. South Dakota
    stands to lose federal funding equaling 28.9% of its annual
    state expenditures. See id., at 7, 47. Withholding $614.7
    million, equaling only 0.19% of all state expenditures
    combined, is aptly characterized as “relatively mild en-
    couragement,” but threatening to withhold $233 billion,
    equaling 21.86% of all state expenditures combined, is a
    different matter.
                                  2
      What the statistics suggest is confirmed by the goal
    and structure of the ACA. In crafting the ACA, Congress
    clearly expressed its informed view that no State could
    possibly refuse the offer that the ACA extends.
      The stated goal of the ACA is near-universal health care
    coverage. To achieve this goal, the ACA mandates that
    every person obtain a minimum level of coverage. It at-
    tempts to reach this goal in several different ways. The
    guaranteed issue and community-rating provisions are
    designed to make qualifying insurance available and
    affordable for persons with medical conditions that may
                       Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)             43
    
            SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    require expensive care. Other ACA provisions seek to
    make such policies more affordable for people of modest
    means.     Finally, for low-income individuals who are
    simply not able to obtain insurance, Congress expanded
    Medicaid, transforming it from a program covering only
    members of a limited list of vulnerable groups into a pro-
    gram that provides at least the requisite minimum level
    of coverage for the poor. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§1396a(a)
    (10)(A)(i)(VIII) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), 1396u–7(a), (b)(5),
    18022(a). This design was intended to provide at least
    a specified minimum level of coverage for all Americans,
    but the achievement of that goal obviously depends on
    participation by every single State. If any State—not
    to mention all of the 26 States that brought this suit—
    chose to decline the federal offer, there would be a gaping
    hole in the ACA’s coverage.
      It is true that some persons who are eligible for Medi-
    caid coverage under the ACA may be able to secure private
    insurance, either through their employers or by obtain-
    ing subsidized insurance through an exchange. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §36B(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV); Brief for Respond-
    ents in No. 11–400, at 12. But the new federal subsidies
    are not available to those whose income is below the fed-
    eral poverty level, and the ACA provides no means, other
    than Medicaid, for these individuals to obtain coverage
    and comply with the Mandate. The Government counters
    that these people will not have to pay the penalty, see, e.g.,
    Tr. of Oral Arg. 68 (Mar. 28, 2012); Brief for Respondents
    in No. 11–400, at 49–50, but that argument misses the
    point: Without Medicaid, these individuals will not have
    coverage and the ACA’s goal of near-universal coverage
    will be severely frustrated.
      If Congress had thought that States might actually
    refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid, Con-
    gress would surely have devised a backup scheme so that
    the most vulnerable groups in our society, those previously
    44       NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 
    
                        BUSINESS v. SEBELIUS
    
            SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    
    eligible for Medicaid, would not be left out in the cold. But
    nowhere in the over 900-page Act is such a scheme to be
    found. By contrast, because Congress thought that some
    States might decline federal funding for the operation of
    a “health benefit exchange,” Congress provided a backup
    scheme; if a State declines to participate in the operation
    of an exchange, the Federal Government will step in
    and operate an exchange in that State. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §18041(c)(1). Likewise, knowing that States would not
    necessarily provide affordable health insurance for aliens
    lawfully present in the United States—because Medicaid
    does not require States to provide such coverage—Con-
    gress extended the availability of the new federal insur-
    ance subsidies to all aliens. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §36B(c)
    (1)(B)(ii) (excepting from the income limit individuals
    who are “not eligible for the medicaid program . . . by
    reason of [their] alien status”). Congress did not make
    these subsidies available for citizens with incomes below
    the poverty level because Congress obviously assumed
    that they would be covered by Medicaid. If Congress had
    contemplated that some of these citizens would be left
    without Medicaid coverage as a result of a State’s with-
    drawal or expulsion from the program, Congress surely
    would have made them eligible for the tax subsidies pro-
    vided for low-income aliens.
       These features of the ACA convey an unmistakable
    message: Congress never dreamed that any State would
    refuse to go along with the expansion of Medicaid. Con-
    gress well understood that refusal was not a practical
    option.
       The Federal Government does not dispute the inference
    that Congress anticipated 100% state participation, but it
    argues that this assumption was based on the fact that
    ACA’s offer was an “exceedingly generous” gift. Brief for
    Respondents in No. 11–400, at 50. As the Federal Gov-
    ernment sees things, Congress is like the generous bene-
                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)

           SCALIA, KENNEDY, THOMAS, and ALITO, JJ., dissenting
    
    
    factor who offers $1 million with few strings attached to
    50 randomly selected individuals. Just as this benefactor
    might assume that all of these 50 individuals would snap
    up his offer, so Congress assumed that every State would
    gratefully accept the federal funds (and conditions) to go
    with the expansion of Medicaid.
       This characterization of the ACA’s offer raises obvious
    questions. If that offer is “exceedingly generous,” as the
    Federal Government maintains, why have more than half
    the States brought this lawsuit, contending that the offer
    is coercive? And why did Congress find it necessary to
    threaten that any State refusing to accept this “exceed-
    ingly generous” gift would risk losing all Medicaid funds?
    Congress could have made just the new funding provided
    under the ACA contingent on acceptance of the terms of
    the Medicaid Expansion. Congress took such an approach
    in some earlier amendments to Medicaid, separating new
    coverage requirements and funding from the rest of the
    program so that only new funding was conditioned on new
    eligibility extensions. See, e.g., Social Security Amend-
    ments of 1972, 86 Stat. 1465.
       Congress’ decision to do otherwise here reflects its un-
    derstanding that the ACA offer is not an “exceedingly
    generous” gift that no State in its right mind would de-
    cline. Instead, acceptance of the offer will impose very
    substantial costs on participating States. It is true that
    the Federal Government will bear most of the initial costs
    associated with the Medicaid Expansion, first paying
    100% of the costs of covering newly eligible individuals
    between 2014 and 2016. 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1396d(y). But that
    is just part of the picture. Participating States will be
    forced to shoulder substantial costs as well, because after
    2019 the Federal Government will cover only 90% of the
    costs associated with the Expansion, see ibid., with state
    spending projected to increase by at least $20 billion by
    2020 as a consequence. Statement of Douglas W. Elmen-

    And these costs may increase in the future because of
    the very real possibility that the Federal Government will
    change funding terms and reduce the percentage of funds
    it will cover. This would leave the States to bear an in-
    creasingly large percentage of the bill. See Tr. of Oral
    Arg. 74–76 (Mar. 28, 2012). Finally, after 2015, the States
    will have to pick up the tab for 50% of all administrative
    costs associated with implementing the new program, see
    §§1396b(a)(2)–(5), (7) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), costs that could
    approach $12 billion between fiscal years 2014 and 2020,
    see Dept. of Health and Human Services, Center for Medi-
    caid and Medicare Services, 2010 Actuarial Report on the
    Financial Outlook for Medicaid 30.
       In sum, it is perfectly clear from the goal and structure
    of the ACA that the offer of the Medicaid Expansion was
    one that Congress understood no State could refuse. The
    Medicaid Expansion therefore exceeds Congress’ spending
    power and cannot be implemented.

    See Part IV–A to IV–E, supra; Part IV–A, ante, at 45–55
    (opinion of ROBERTS, C. J., joined by BREYER and KAGAN,
    JJ.). Because the Medicaid Expansion is unconstitutional,
    the question of remedy arises. The most natural remedy

    would be to invalidate the Medicaid Expansion. However,
    the Government proposes—in two cursory sentences at
    the very end of its brief—preserving the Expansion. Under
    its proposal, States would receive the additional Medi-
    caid funds if they expand eligibility, but States would
    keep their pre-existing Medicaid funds if they do not
    expand eligibility. We cannot accept the Government’s
    suggestion.
       The reality that States were given no real choice but to
    expand Medicaid was not an accident. Congress assumed
    States would have no choice, and the ACA depends on
    States’ having no choice, because its Mandate requires
    low-income individuals to obtain insurance many of them
    can afford only through the Medicaid Expansion. Fur-
    thermore, a State’s withdrawal might subject everyone in
    the State to much higher insurance premiums. That is
    because the Medicaid Expansion will no longer offset the
    cost to the insurance industry imposed by the ACA’s in-
    surance regulations and taxes, a point that is explained in
    more detail in the severability section below. To make the
    Medicaid Expansion optional despite the ACA’s structure
    and design “ ‘would be to make a new law, not to enforce
    an old one. This is no part of our duty.’ ” Trade-Mark

    , 99 (1879).
       Worse, the Government’s proposed remedy introduces a
    new dynamic: States must choose between expanding
    Medicaid or paying huge tax sums to the federal fisc for
    the sole benefit of expanding Medicaid in other States. If
    this divisive dynamic between and among States can be
    introduced at all, it should be by conscious congressional
    choice, not by Court-invented interpretation. We do not
    doubt that States are capable of making decisions when
    put in a tight spot. We do doubt the authority of this
    Court to put them there.
       The Government cites a severability clause codified with
    Medicaid in Chapter 7 of the United States Code stating
    48        NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT

    that if “any provision of this chapter, or the application
    thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the
    remainder of the chapter, and the application of such
    provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
    affected thereby.” 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1303 (2006 ed.). But that
    clause tells us only that other provisions in Chapter 7
    should not be invalidated if §1396c, the authorization for
    the cut-off of all Medicaid funds, is unconstitutional. It
    does not tell us that §1396c can be judicially revised, to
    say what it does not say. Such a judicial power would
    not be called the doctrine of severability but perhaps
    the doctrine of amendatory invalidation—similar to the
    amendatory veto that permits the Governors of some
    States to reduce the amounts appropriated in legislation.
    The proof that such a power does not exist is the fact that
    it would not preserve other congressional dispositions, but
    would leave it up to the Court what the “validated” legis-
    lation will contain. The Court today opts for permitting
    the cut-off of only incremental Medicaid funding, but it
    might just as well have permitted, say, the cut-off of funds
    that represent no more than x percent of the State’s bud-
    get. The Court severs nothing, but simply revises §1396c to
    read as the Court would desire.
       We should not accept the Government’s invitation to
    attempt to solve a constitutional problem by rewriting the
    Medicaid Expansion so as to allow States that reject it
    to retain their pre-existing Medicaid funds. Worse, the
    Government’s remedy, now adopted by the Court, takes
    the ACA and this Nation in a new direction and charts a
    course for federalism that the Court, not the Congress, has
    chosen; but under the Constitution, that power and au-
    thority do not rest with this Court.

    universal” health insurance coverage. §18091(2)(D) (2006
    ed., Supp. IV). The two pillars of the Act are the Individ-
    ual Mandate and the expansion of coverage under Medicaid.
    In our view, both these central provisions of the Act—the
    Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion—are invalid.
    It follows, as some of the parties urge, that all other provi-
    sions of the Act must fall as well. The following section
    explains the severability principles that require this con-
    clusion. This analysis also shows how closely interrelated
    the Act is, and this is all the more reason why it is judicial
    usurpation to impose an entirely new mechanism for
    withdrawal of Medicaid funding, see Part IV–F, supra,
    which is one of many examples of how rewriting the Act
    alters its dynamics.

       When an unconstitutional provision is but a part of a
    more comprehensive statute, the question arises as to the
    validity of the remaining provisions. The Court’s author-
    ity to declare a statute partially unconstitutional has been
    well established since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137
    (1803), when the Court severed an unconstitutional provi-
    sion from the Judiciary Act of 1789. And while the Court
    has sometimes applied “at least a modest presumption in
    favor of . . . severability,” C. Nelson, Statutory Interpreta-
    tion 144 (2010), it has not always done so, see, e.g., Minne-

    provision unconstitutional, it then determines whether
    the now truncated statute will operate in the manner Con-
    gress intended. If not, the remaining provisions must be
    invalidated. See id., at 685. In Alaska Airlines, the Court
    clarified that this first inquiry requires more than ask-
    ing whether “the balance of the legislation is incapable of
    functioning independently.” Id., at 684. Even if the re-
    maining provisions will operate in some coherent way,
    that alone does not save the statute. The question is
    whether the provisions will work as Congress intended.
    The “relevant inquiry in evaluating severability is whether
    the statute will function in a manner consistent with
    the intent of Congress.” Id., at 685 (emphasis in original).

       The two inquiries—whether the remaining provisions
    will operate as Congress designed them, and whether
    Congress would have enacted the remaining provisions
    standing alone—often are interrelated. In the ordinary
    course, if the remaining provisions cannot operate accord-
    ing to the congressional design (the first inquiry), it almost
    necessarily follows that Congress would not have enacted
    them (the second inquiry). This close interaction may
    explain why the Court has not always been precise in
    distinguishing between the two. There are, however,
    occasions in which the severability standard’s first inquiry
    (statutory functionality) is not a proxy for the second
    inquiry (whether the Legislature intended the remaining
    provisions to stand alone).

    other requirements; comprehensive regulation and penal-
    ties; some undoubted taxes; and increases in some gov-
    ernmental expenditures, decreases in others. Under the
    severability test set out above, it must be determined if
    those provisions function in a coherent way and as Con-
    gress would have intended, even when the major provi-
    sions establishing the Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion are themselves invalid.
       Congress did not intend to establish the goal of near-
    universal coverage without regard to fiscal consequences.
    See, e.g., ACA §1563, 124 Stat. 270 (“[T]his Act will reduce
    the Federal deficit between 2010 and 2019”). And it did
    not intend to impose the inevitable costs on any one indus-
    try or group of individuals. The whole design of the Act
    is to balance the costs and benefits affecting each set
    of regulated parties. Thus, individuals are required to
    obtain health insurance. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §5000A(a). Insur-
    ance companies are required to sell them insurance re-
    gardless of patients’ pre-existing conditions and to comply

    . §18071 (2006 ed., Supp. IV)
    (federal subsidies). The Federal Government’s increased
    spending is offset by new taxes and cuts in other federal
    expenditures, including reductions in Medicare and in
    federal payments to hospitals. See, e.g., §1395ww(r) (Med-
    icare cuts); ACA Title IX, Subtitle A, 124 Stat. 847 (“Rev-
    enue Offset Provisions”). Employers with at least 50
    employees must either provide employees with adequate
    health benefits or pay a financial exaction if an employee
    who qualifies for federal subsidies purchases insurance
    through an exchange. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4980H (2006 ed.,
    Supp. IV).
       In short, the Act attempts to achieve near-universal
    health insurance coverage by spreading its costs to indi-
    viduals, insurers, governments, hospitals, and employers—
    while, at the same time, offsetting significant portions
    of those costs with new benefits to each group. For ex-
    ample, the Federal Government bears the burden of pay-
    ing billions for the new entitlements mandated by the
    Medicaid Expansion and federal subsidies for insurance
    purchases on the exchanges; but it benefits from reduc-
    tions in the reimbursements it pays to hospitals. Hospi-
    tals lose those reimbursements; but they benefit from the
    decrease in uncompensated care, for under the insurance
    regulations it is easier for individuals with pre-existing
    conditions to purchase coverage that increases payments
    to hospitals. Insurance companies bear new costs imposed
    by a collection of insurance regulations and taxes, including
    “guaranteed issue” and “community rating” requirements
    to give coverage regardless of the insured’s pre-existing
    conditions; but the insurers benefit from the new, healthy
    purchasers who are forced by the Individual Mandate
    to buy the insurers’ product and from the new low-
    income Medicaid recipients who will enroll in insurance
    companies’ Medicaid-funded managed care programs. In
    summary, the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expan-

    sion offset insurance regulations and taxes, which offset
    reduced reimbursements to hospitals, which offset in-
    creases in federal spending. So, the Act’s major provisions
    are interdependent.
      The Act then refers to these interdependencies as
    “shared responsibility.” See ACA Subtitle F, Title I, 124
    Stat. 242 (“Shared Responsibility”); ACA §1501, ibid.
    (same); ACA §1513, id., at 253 (same); ACA §4980H, ibid.
    (same). In at least six places, the Act describes the Indi-
    vidual Mandate as working “together with the other pro-
    visions of this Act.” 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18091(2)(C) (2006 ed.,
    Supp. IV) (working “together” to “add millions of new
    consumers to the health insurance market”); §18091(2)(E)
    (working “together” to “significantly reduce” the economic
    cost of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the unin-
    sured); §18091(2)(F) (working “together” to “lower health
    insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(G) (working “together” to
    “improve financial security for families”); §18091(2)(I)
    (working “together” to minimize “adverse selection and
    broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy
    individuals”); §18091(2)(J) (working “together” to “signif-
    icantly reduce administrative costs and lower health
    insurance premiums”). The Act calls the Individual Man-
    date “an essential part” of federal regulation of health
    insurance and warns that “the absence of the requirement
    would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance
    market.” §18091(2)(H).

      One preliminary point should be noted before applying
    severability principles to the Act. To be sure, an argument
    can be made that those portions of the Act that none of the
    parties has standing to challenge cannot be held nonse-
    verable. The response to this argument is that our cases
    do not support it. See, e.g., Williams v. Standard Oil Co.

    able statutory provisions that did not burden the parties).
    It would be particularly destructive of sound government
    to apply such a rule with regard to a multifaceted piece of
    legislation like the ACA. It would take years, perhaps
    decades, for each of its provisions to be adjudicated sepa-
    rately—and for some of them (those simply expending
    federal funds) no one may have separate standing. The
    Federal Government, the States, and private parties ought
    to know at once whether the entire legislation fails.
       The opinion now explains in Part V–C–1, infra, why the
    Act’s major provisions are not severable from the Mandate
    and Medicaid Expansion. It proceeds from the insurance
    regulations and taxes (C–1–a), to the reductions in reim-
    bursements to hospitals and other Medicare reductions
    (C–1–b), the exchanges and their federal subsidies (C–1–c),
    and the employer responsibility assessment (C–1–d).
    Part V–C–2, infra, explains why the Act’s minor provi-
    sions also are not severable.

                   The Act’s Major Provisions
      Major provisions of the Affordable Care Act—i.e., the
    insurance regulations and taxes, the reductions in federal
    reimbursements to hospitals and other Medicare spend-
    ing reductions, the exchanges and their federal subsidies,
    and the employer responsibility assessment—cannot remain
    once the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expansion are
    invalid. That result follows from the undoubted inability
    of the other major provisions to operate as Congress in-
    tended without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion. Absent the invalid portions, the other major
    provisions could impose enormous risks of unexpected bur-
    dens on patients, the health-care community, and the
    federal budget. That consequence would be in absolute
    conflict with the ACA’s design of “shared responsibility,”
    and would pose a threat to the Nation that Congress did

                Insurance Regulations and Taxes
       Without the Individual Mandate and Medicaid Expan-
    sion, the Affordable Care Act’s insurance regulations and
    insurance taxes impose risks on insurance companies and
    their customers that this Court cannot measure. Those
    risks would undermine Congress’ scheme of “shared re-
    sponsibility.” See

       The Court has been informed by distinguished econo-
    mists that the Act’s Individual Mandate and Medicaid
    Expansion would each increase revenues to the insurance
    industry by about $350 billion over 10 years; that this
    combined figure of $700 billion is necessary to offset the
    approximately $700 billion in new costs to the insurance
    industry imposed by the Act’s insurance regulations and
    taxes; and that the new $700-billion burden would other-
    wise dwarf the industry’s current profit margin. See Brief
    for Economists as Amici Curiae in No. 11–393 etc. (Sever-
    ability), pp. 9–16, 10a.
       If that analysis is correct, the regulations and taxes will
    mean higher costs for insurance companies. Higher costs
    may mean higher premiums for consumers, despite the
    Act’s goal of “lower[ing] health insurance premiums.”

    markets.” §18091(2)(J).

       The actual cost of the regulations and taxes may be
    more or less than predicted. What is known, however, is
    that severing other provisions from the Individual Man-
    date and Medicaid Expansion necessarily would impose
    significant risks and real uncertainties on insurance com-
    panies, their customers, all other major actors in the sys-
    tem, and the government treasury. And what also is
    known is this: Unnecessary risks and avoidable uncertain-
    ties are hostile to economic progress and fiscal stability
    and thus to the safety and welfare of the Nation and the
    Nation’s freedom. If those risks and uncertainties are to
    be imposed, it must not be by the Judiciary.
                                 b
       Reductions in Reimbursements to Hospitals and
          Other Reductions in Medicare Expenditures
      The Affordable Care Act reduces payments by the Fed-
    eral Government to hospitals by more than $200 billion
    over 10 years. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1395ww(b)(3)(B)(xi)–(xii)
    (2006 ed., Supp. IV); §1395ww(q); §1395ww(r); §1396r–
    4(f)(7).
      The concept is straightforward: Near-universal coverage
    will reduce uncompensated care, which will increase hos-
    pitals’ revenues, which will offset the government’s re-
    ductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to
    hospitals. Responsibility will be shared, as burdens and
    benefits balance each other. This is typical of the whole
    dynamic of the Act.
      Invalidating the key mechanisms for expanding insur-
    ance coverage, such as community rating and the Medi-
    caid Expansion, without invalidating the reductions in
    Medicare and Medicaid, distorts the ACA’s design of
    “shared responsibility.” Some hospitals may be forced to
    raise the cost of care in order to offset the reductions in
    reimbursements, which could raise the cost of insurance
    premiums, in contravention of the Act’s goal of “lower[ing]

    health insurance premiums.”

    . §18091(2)(F)
    (2006 ed., Supp. IV). See also §18091(2)(I) (goal of
    “lower[ing] health insurance premiums”); §18091(2)(J)
    (same). Other hospitals, particularly safety-net hospitals that
    serve a large number of uninsured patients, may be forced
    to shut down. Cf. National Assn. of Public Hospitals, 2009
    Annual Survey: Safety Net Hospitals and Health Systems
    Fulfill Mission in Uncertain Times 5–6 (Feb. 2011). Like
    the effect of preserving the insurance regulations and
    taxes, the precise degree of risk to hospitals is unknow-
    able. It is not the proper role of the Court, by severing
    part of a statute and allowing the rest to stand, to impose
    unknowable risks that Congress could neither measure
    nor predict. And Congress could not have intended that
    result in any event.
       There is a second, independent reason why the reduc-
    tions in reimbursements to hospitals and the ACA’s other
    Medicare cuts must be invalidated. The ACA’s $455 bil-
    lion in Medicare and Medicaid savings offset the $434-
    billion cost of the Medicaid Expansion. See CBO Esti-
    mate, Table 2 (Mar. 20, 2010). The reductions allowed
    Congress to find that the ACA “will reduce the Federal
    deficit between 2010 and 2019” and “will continue to
    reduce budget deficits after 2019.” ACA §§1563(a)(1), (2),
    124 Stat. 270.
       That finding was critical to the ACA. The Act’s “shared
    responsibility” concept extends to the federal budget.
    Congress chose to offset new federal expenditures with
    budget cuts and tax increases. That is why the United
    States has explained in the course of this litigation that
    “[w]hen Congress passed the ACA, it was careful to ensure
    that any increased spending, including on Medicaid, was
    offset by other revenue-raising and cost-saving provi-
    sions.” Memorandum in Support of Government’s Motion
    for Summary Judgment in No. 3–10–cv–91, p. 41.

       Health Insurance Exchanges and Their Federal
                             Subsidies
      The ACA requires each State to establish a health-
    insurance “exchange.” Each exchange is a one-stop mar-
    ketplace for individuals and small businesses to compare
    community-rated health insurance and purchase the
    policy of their choice. The exchanges cannot operate in the
    manner Congress intended if the Individual Mandate,
    Medicaid Expansion, and insurance regulations cannot
    remain in force.
      The Act’s design is to allocate billions of federal dollars
    to subsidize individuals’ purchases on the exchanges. In-
    dividuals with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of
    the poverty level receive tax credits to offset the cost of
    insurance to the individual purchaser.

    obtain insurance through an exchange are expected to
    receive an average federal subsidy of $6,460 per person.

    the average federal subsidy could be much higher; for
    community rating greatly lowers the enormous premiums
    unhealthy individuals would otherwise pay.          Federal
    subsidies would make up much of the difference.
       The result would be an unintended boon to insurance
    companies, an unintended harm to the federal fisc, and
    a corresponding breakdown of the “shared responsibil-
    ity” between the industry and the federal budget that
    Congress intended. Thus, the federal subsidies must be
    invalidated.
       In the absence of federal subsidies to purchasers, insur-
    ance companies will have little incentive to sell insurance
    on the exchanges. Under the ACA’s scheme, few, if any,
    individuals would want to buy individual insurance poli-
    cies outside of an exchange, because federal subsidies
    would be unavailable outside of an exchange. Difficulty in
    attracting individuals outside of the exchange would in
    turn motivate insurers to enter exchanges, despite the
    exchanges’ onerous regulations. See 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §18031.
    That system of incentives collapses if the federal subsidies
    are invalidated. Without the federal subsidies, individ-
    uals would lose the main incentive to purchase insurance
    inside the exchanges, and some insurers may be unwilling
    to offer insurance inside of exchanges. With fewer buyers
    and even fewer sellers, the exchanges would not operate
    as Congress intended and may not operate at all.
       There is a second reason why, if community rating is
    invalidated by the Mandate and Medicaid Expansion’s
    invalidity, exchanges cannot be implemented in a manner
    consistent with the Act’s design. A key purpose of an
    exchange is to provide a marketplace of insurance options
    where prices are standardized regardless of the buy-
    er’s pre-existing conditions. See ibid. An individual who
    shops for insurance through an exchange will evaluate
    different insurance products. The products will offer
    different benefits and prices. Congress designed the ex-
                      Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)

    changes so the shopper can compare benefits and prices.
    But the comparison cannot be made in the way Congress
    designed if the prices depend on the shopper’s pre-existing
    health conditions. The prices would vary from person to
    person. So without community rating—which prohibits
    insurers from basing the price of insurance on pre-existing
    conditions—the exchanges cannot operate in the manner
    Congress intended.
                                  d
              Employer-Responsibility Assessment
      The employer responsibility assessment provides an
    incentive for employers with at least 50 employees to
    provide their employees with health insurance options
    that meet minimum criteria. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4980H
    (2006 ed., Supp. IV). Unlike the Individual Mandate,
    the employer-responsibility assessment does not require
    employers to provide an insurance option. Instead, it re-
    quires them to make a payment to the Federal Govern-
    ment if they do not offer insurance to employees and if
    insurance is bought on an exchange by an employee who
    qualifies for the exchange’s federal subsidies. See ibid.
      For two reasons, the employer-responsibility assessment
    must be invalidated. First, the ACA makes a direct link
    between the employer-responsibility assessment and the
    exchanges. The financial assessment against employers
    occurs only under certain conditions. One of them is the
    purchase of insurance by an employee on an exchange.
    With no exchanges, there are no purchases on the ex-
    changes; and with no purchases on the exchanges, there is
    nothing to trigger the employer-responsibility assessment.
      Second, after the invalidation of burdens on individuals
    (the Individual Mandate), insurers (the insurance regu-
    lations and taxes), States (the Medicaid Expansion), the
    Federal Government (the federal subsidies for exchanges
    and for the Medicaid Expansion), and hospitals (the reduc-

    tions in reimbursements), the preservation of the employer-
    responsibility assessment would upset the ACA’s design
    of “shared responsibility.” It would leave employers as the
    only parties bearing any significant responsibility. That
    was not the congressional intent.

                    The Act’s Minor Provisions
        The next question is whether the invalidation of the
    ACA’s major provisions requires the Court to invalidate
    the ACA’s other provisions. It does.
        The ACA is over 900 pages long. Its regulations include
    requirements ranging from a break time and secluded
    place at work for nursing mothers, see 

29 U.S. C

    
    
    . §207(r)(1)
    (2006 ed., Supp. IV), to displays of nutritional content
    at chain restaurants, see 

21 U.S. C

    
    
    . §343(q)(5)(H).
    The Act raises billions of dollars in taxes and fees, includ-
    ing exactions imposed on high-income taxpayers, see ACA
    §§9015, 10906; HCERA §1402, medical devices, see 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4191 (2006 ed., Supp. IV), and tanning booths,
    see §5000B. It spends government money on, among other
    things, the study of how to spend less government money.
    

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1315a. And it includes a number of provisions
    that provide benefits to the State of a particular legislator.
    For example, §10323, 124 Stat. 954, extends Medicare
    coverage to individuals exposed to asbestos from a mine in
    Libby, Montana. Another provision, §2006, id., at 284,
    increases Medicaid payments only in Louisiana.
        Such provisions validate the Senate Majority Leader’s
    statement, “ ‘I don’t know if there is a senator that doesn’t
    have something in this bill that was important to them.
    . . . [And] if they don’t have something in it important to
    them, then it doesn’t speak well of them. That’s what this
    legislation is all about: It’s the art of compromise.’ ” Pear,

    minor provision will be the price paid for support of a
    major provision. So, if the major provision were unconsti-
    tutional, Congress would not have passed the minor one.
       Without the ACA’s major provisions, many of these
    minor provisions will not operate in the manner Congress
    intended. For example, the tax increases are “Revenue
    Offset Provisions” designed to help offset the cost to the
    Federal Government of programs like the Medicaid Ex-
    pansion and the exchanges’ federal subsidies. See Title
    IX, Subtitle A—Revenue Offset Provisions, 124 Stat. 847.
    With the Medicaid Expansion and the exchanges invali-
    dated, the tax increases no longer operate to offset costs,
    and they no longer serve the purpose in the Act’s scheme
    of “shared responsibility” that Congress intended.
       Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to
    display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as
    Congress intended, but they fail the second test for sever-
    ability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would
    have enacted them independently. The Court has not
    previously had occasion to consider severability in the con-
    text of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which in-
    cludes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its
    central provisions but also many that are entirely unre-
    lated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them
    passed despite opposition, or because their proponents
    could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their
    needed support. When we are confronted with such a so-
    called “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane
    ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule
    must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments
    are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing
    which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It
    is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not
    a proper function of this Court to guess which. To sever
    the statute in that manner “ ‘would be to make a new law,
    not to enforce an old one. This is not part of our duty.’ ”

    Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S., at 99.
      This Court must not impose risks unintended by Con-
    gress or produce legislation Congress may have lacked the
    support to enact. For those reasons, the unconstitution-
    ality of both the Individual Mandate and the Medicaid
    Expansion requires the invalidation of the Affordable Care
    Act’s other provisions.
                             *    *     *
       The Court today decides to save a statute Congress did
    not write. It rules that what the statute declares to be a
    requirement with a penalty is instead an option subject
    to a tax. And it changes the intentionally coercive sanc-
    tion of a total cut-off of Medicaid funds to a supposedly
    noncoercive cut-off of only the incremental funds that the
    Act makes available.
       The Court regards its strained statutory interpretation
    as judicial modesty. It is not. It amounts instead to a vast
    judicial overreaching. It creates a debilitated, inoperable
    version of health-care regulation that Congress did not
    enact and the public does not expect. It makes enactment
    of sensible health-care regulation more difficult, since
    Congress cannot start afresh but must take as its point of
    departure a jumble of now senseless provisions, provisions
    that certain interests favored under the Court’s new de-
    sign will struggle to retain. And it leaves the public and
    the States to expend vast sums of money on requirements
    that may or may not survive the necessary congressional
    revision.
       The Court’s disposition, invented and atextual as it is,
    does not even have the merit of avoiding constitutional
    difficulties. It creates them. The holding that the Indi-
    vidual Mandate is a tax raises a difficult constitutional
    question (what is a direct tax?) that the Court resolves
    with inadequate deliberation. And the judgment on the
    Medicaid Expansion issue ushers in new federalism con-
                       Cite as: 567 U. S. ____ (2012)

    cerns and places an unaccustomed strain upon the Union.
    Those States that decline the Medicaid Expansion must
    subsidize, by the federal tax dollars taken from their
    citizens, vast grants to the States that accept the Medicaid
    Expansion. If that destabilizing political dynamic, so
    antagonistic to a harmonious Union, is to be introduced at
    all, it should be by Congress, not by the Judiciary.
       The values that should have determined our course to-
    day are caution, minimalism, and the understanding that
    the Federal Government is one of limited powers. But
    the Court’s ruling undermines those values at every turn.
    In the name of restraint, it overreaches. In the name of
    constitutional avoidance, it creates new constitutional
    questions. In the name of cooperative federalism, it un-
    dermines state sovereignty.
       The Constitution, though it dates from the founding of
    the Republic, has powerful meaning and vital relevance
    to our own times. The constitutional protections that this
    case involves are protections of structure. Structural
    protections—notably, the restraints imposed by federalism
    and separation of powers—are less romantic and have less
    obvious a connection to personal freedom than the provi-
    sions of the Bill of Rights or the Civil War Amendments.
    Hence they tend to be undervalued or even forgotten by
    our citizens. It should be the responsibility of the Court to
    teach otherwise, to remind our people that the Framers
    considered structural protections of freedom the most im-
    portant ones, for which reason they alone were embod-
    ied in the original Constitution and not left to later
    amendment. The fragmentation of power produced by the
    structure of our Government is central to liberty, and
    when we destroy it, we place liberty at peril. Today’s
    decision should have vindicated, should have taught, this
    truth; instead, our judgment today has disregarded it.
       For the reasons here stated, we would find the Act in-
    valid in its entirety. We respectfully dissent.

      I dissent for the reasons stated in our joint opinion, but
    I write separately to say a word about the Commerce
    Clause. The joint dissent and THE CHIEF JUSTICE cor-
    rectly apply our precedents to conclude that the Individual
    Mandate is beyond the power granted to Congress un-
    der the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper
    Clause. Under those precedents, Congress may regulate
    “economic activity [that] substantially affects interstate
    commerce.” United States v. Lopez,

    ‘substantial effects’ test under the Commerce Clause is

    powers and with this Court’s early Commerce Clause
    cases.” United States v. Morrison,

    , 67–69 (2005) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As I have
    explained, the Court’s continued use of that test “has
    encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view
    that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits.” Morri-
    son, supra, at 627. The Government’s unprecedented
    claim in this suit that it may regulate not only economic
    activity but also inactivity that substantially affects inter-
    state commerce is a case in point.
