# Equal Protection of the laws 

The Equal Protection Clause comprises the following parts of the text of the 14th Amendment: "no state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

Let's start by noticing some of the textual ambiguity here. 

- Who is a "person?" But that's the easiest question. Here are some harder ones. 

- First, is there a similar principle that applies to the federal government? The text says "state."  Does that mean the feds can do things like engage in race discrimination? 

There isn't an equal protection clause for the feds written into the constitution, but in *Bolling v. Sharpe* the Court basically turned around and applied equal protection principles to the federal government through the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. Some people think this was a dubious move, and that there's reason to think that equal protection principles apply less stringently (if at all) to the feds than to the states.

Another is what counts as "equal" law. One way to think about the idea of equal law is law that treats everyone the same. Another is law that treats people equally given their circumstances. Here's an example: a hypothetical law "everyone must pay a poll tax of ten thousand dollars in order to vote" nominally treats everyone the same, but is it really an "equal" law, or is it a law that treats the poor unequally?

Finally, another puzzle is the use of the word "protection." Does that limit the scope of the equal protection clause? We'll talk about that in a moment. First, a little bit more background and context.

## Let's be originalist for a second.

If we think about the actual history of the equal protection clause, it was, of course, enacted to protect groups, and in particular one group: black folks. After all, the Fourteenth Amendment was one of the three Reconstruction Amendments, imposed on the defeated South after the Civil War; in the context of the Thirteenth Amendment, outlawing slavery, and the Fifteenth Amendment, establishing the right to vote for black people, it is obvious that the point was to regularize the legal status of freed slaves. So, for an originalist, the Equal Protection Clause pretty clearly is about protecting against group discrimination rather than protecting against singling out individuals to demand bigger water pipe easements or some such nonsense.

One way to read the idea of equal protection is as about the literal "protection" of the law. One critical way that the South oppressed black people from Reconstruction through Jim Crow is by failing to protect black citizens from white violence. The Southern states simply failed to enforce the laws against things like murder and assault and arson against white people who committed those crimes against black people, thus allowing organized racial terror groups like the Klu Klux Klan, lynch mobs, etc. to run rampant. On a literal textualist reading of the Equal Protection Clause, this is the core behavior it was intended to forbid. White people had the protection of the laws from violence, black people didn't.

For some strong evidence of this interpretation, see the Enforcement Act of 1871 (better known as the Ku Klux Klan act), 17 Stat. 13 (posted on ICON). Most significantly, section 3 of the act reads in relevant part as follows:

> That in all cases where insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combinations, or conspiracies in any State shall so obstruct or hinder the execution of the laws thereof, and of the United States, as to deprive any portion or class of the people of such State of any of the rights, privileges, or immunities, or protection, named in the constitution and secured by this act, and the constituted authorities of such State shall either be unable to protect, or shall, from any cause, fail in or refuse protection of the people in such rights, such facts shall be deemed a denial by such State of the equal protection of the laws to which they are entitled under the constitution of the United States: and in all such cases... it shall be lawful for the President, and it shall be his duty to take such measures, by the employment of the militia or the land and naval forces of the United States... as he may deem necessary for the suppression of such insurrection, domestic violence, or conspiracies.

(Emphasis mine.) Section 4 of the act goes on to address cases in which "the constituted authorities are in complicity with, or shall connive at the unlawful purposes of, such powerful and armed combinations," and authorizes the President to suspend habeas corpus.

But we now universally think the Equal Protection Clause covers a much broader scope. It's well established that the equal protection clause covers discrimination against people other than African-Americans, and that it prohibits discriminatory law in general, not just---or perhaps not even---the mere failure to protect people against private criminality. (I say perhaps not even because there's some nasty caselaw about there being no private claim for police failure to protect, although there are still arguments available---see generally *DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services*, 489 U.S. 189 (1989). This has been a particular issue in domestic violence cases, about which Harvard's Berkman center has a really interesting discussion at this link: [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/basics.html](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/vaw00/basics.html).) At any rate, it's well settled that the equal protection clause bars things other than race discrimination against African-Americans, and it bars discriminatory law in general, not just letting racist terrorists kill people.

### Classification vs subordination

There are two ways of interpreting the idea of discriminatory law. One is "the classification approach." The idea here is that a law discriminates, and thus is subject to equal protection challenge, if it treats people differently. On the classification approach, it doesn't matter whether the law that treats people differently is good or bad for some subordinated minority group. For example, a law providing favorable treatment to black people is just as subject to challenge as a law injuring black people.

The other approach is the subordination approach. The idea there is that the Equal Protection Clause isn't about people being treated differently, it's about unjust social hierarchy. So if laws perpetuating unjust social hierarchy are what the Clause prohibits, then there's only a challenge when a law actually picks on, not just anyone, but someone on the bottom of the totem pole. On that conception of Equal Protection, a law picking on black folks and favoring white folks is subject to challenge, but a law picking on white folks and favoring black folks isn't, because of the existence of background racial hierarchy favoring whites over blacks.

The choice between those two conceptions of equal protection is a subject of hot academic dispute. The defenders of the subordination approach have two main arguments: first, a historical or originalist argument: the same victorious northern abolitionist republicans who imposed the Fourteenth Amendment on the South also passed a bunch of laws that quite explicitly provided favorable treatment to freed slaves. For example, Congress set up the Freedmen's Bureau, which provided copious financial assistance to former slaves, and attempted to carry out outright redistribution. And this also makes more sense in context. If the purpose of the amendment at the time was to regularize the status of freed slaves, then this doesn't mean treating the freed slaves the same as the enslavers, it means raising the condition of the freed slaves until they can stand on an equal footing. The second is a philosophical and moral argument about what equal law means... that argument is a bit more complex, but if you want the very best version of it, well, I published that article myself, it's called Equal Law in an Unequal World. Feel free to read it.

By contrast, the classification approach defenders have a very strong argument of their own, which is fundamentally that the courts are not competent to adjudicate social hierarchy. Can you imagine showing up to court and having to convince a court, ok, group A is socially dominant relative to group B, so the law ought to allow discrimination in favor of B and against A? This is practically the definition of a political question, something so messy and controversial that it seems like it would be outrageous to allow the judicial branch to make rulings about it.

But I said "academic dispute" for a reason. As a matter of doctrine, the Supreme Court has come down pretty squarely on the side of the classification approach. This isn't necessarily permanent. Lots of academics and some activists (particularly on the political left) advocate for the Court to go to the subordination approach. So the first step in any equal protection claim is to establish that the challenged state action classifies people into some kind of group (even a group of one, about which more later) along some dimension, like race, gender, sexual orientation, or, really, any kind of classification, like neighborhood or hair color or political party or whatever.

Ok, so that's really the basis for understanding equal protection. You need to understand that stuff, because it'll help us explain the weird decisions that seem to come down from the Supreme Court on the daily. Now let's drill down some into the details.

## Actually analyzing EPC cases

So with all that groundwork laid, how do we actually analyze equal protection cases? There are two ideas we need to get out.

### More and less suspect classifications

First is the idea of different kinds of suspicion attached to different classifications. If we're going to be originalists at all, then we can't just flat-out ignore the fact that this Amendment was put into the constitution in order to prevent race discrimination. If we know *nothing else* about the Fourteenth Amendment, we know that. So, intuitively, the courts ought to have a shorter fuse for race discrimination than for other kinds of discrimination. In fact, for an originalist, it need not be obvious that the Equal Protection Clause ought to do anything other than prevent race discrimination. In general, even if we follow the classification approach, we ought to think that some kinds of classification are more worrisome for the purposes of equal protection scrutiny than others.

"But wait!" you say. "Why do we need to do this at all? Why don't we just forbid classifications?" Well, we can't do that. Every law is a classification. The law "people under 21 can't buy booze" is an obvious example, but obviously we don't want that to be unconstitutional. "Latino people can't buy booze?" Clearly unconstitutional. One way to explain those judgments is to say that racial classifications get treated more suspiciously than age classifications. And, indeed, that's exactly what we do. Recognizing that every law classifies citizens into a group of people that are covered and a group of people that aren't, the Supreme Court has established a hierarchy of classifications ordered by their level of suspiciousness. 

There are a bunch of different groups, and I'll give you a handout later on which summarizes all of this for you. But here's the secret takeaway in all of this. The subordination view has snuck back into the classification view, it has to sneak back into the classification view, because we have to have a way of telling which classifications are nasty and which are not nasty, otherwise we have to give careful equal protection scrutiny to laws that distinguish between children and adults, or people convicted of felonies and people not convicted of felonies, and all kinds of other classifications that we intuitively accept.

For right now, the minimum you need to know is this: 
1.  Race is a suspect classification, meaning that when the government classifies people by race it is very likely to get struck down. There are other suspect classifications, but race is the big one. 

2.  Gender is a semi-suspect classification, meaning that when the government classifies by gender, it's still quite likely, although not as likely, to get struck down. 

3.  Most other kinds of classifications are not suspect classifications, meaning that it's pretty likely for such classifications to be upheld.

One of the most persistent questions in all of equal protection law is how to decide what's a suspect classification. Race is the easy case, because, again, the amendment was written to stop race discrimination. But there are lots of other issues about how we figure out which other categories get treated as suspicious. Does it have something to do with a history of discrimination? Does it have something to do with that idea given in the Carolene products of "discrete and insular minorities," that is, people who are easy to target and too politically weak, because a minority, to defend themselves in the political process? We'll explore that in more detail in a few weeks.

It's also worth noting that there's a kind of Equal Protection scrutiny that covers cases where there isn't really a classification at all, just the government picking on someone.  This is called "class of one" equal protection, and the classic case is  *Village of Willowbrook v. Olech*, 528 U.S. 562 (2000). There, the Court held that a plaintiff could raise an equal protection challenge to a city requirement that she grant a 33 foot easement on her property as a condition of getting a connection to the city water supply. The basis of the challenge was that the plaintiff was treated differently: other citizens seeking water connections had only been required to give up 15-foot easements. Effectively, Olech claimed that the decision was illegal for unjustifiably treating her differently from everyone else. And this was addressed under "rational basis scrutiny," about which much more below. 


### Levels of scrutiny

A level of scrutiny is a way of expressing an overall balancing test, where what we're balancing is the importance of what the government is trying to achieve by the classification and necessity of the classification to the government's ends against the perniciousness of the kind of classification the government is making.

Before we actually describe the levels of scrutiny, it's best to get a handle on the concept by developing some intuition about the underlying balancing test. Suppose a serial killer is on the loose in Iowa City, and all the police have to go on is that a redhead was seen buying a bunch of weapons. Can the police go and interrogate all redheads? Suppose you represent a redhead who is being followed by the police, and you file an equal protection lawsuit, what result would you expect? Stop and think about it for a minute.

It's pretty reasonable to think that the police will win this one. Why? Well, the need is pretty dire---people are going to die if they don't act, the only way they can act is by discriminating against redheads, and hair color is not a suspect classification --- there's no long nasty history of discriminating against people based on hair color, etc.

Now consider a different kind of case. Suppose there's some weakish statistical evidence that men are marginally more likely to speed than women, and accordingly, the state of Iowa passes a law that charges men an extra $500 a year for auto registration. It's obvious that this is a much weaker case for the government: gender is a semi-suspect classification, so that side of the balancing scale doesn't look so good---there is lots of historical gender-based discrimination, so the courts tend to be more suspicious of it. On the other side, reducing speeding isn't nearly as urgent a government interest as stopping a serial killer,^[Or is it? After all, traffic kills lots more people than Charles Manson-types...] and there isn't that close a tie between this auto registration fee and that goal. The government probably loses this one.

So that's the underlying logic behind the analysis of all equal protection cases---or, at least, all equal protection cases that depend on classification. There's a different category of equal protection case, called a fundamental rights case, which we'll get to later.

HOWEVER we don't actually do an explicit balancing test when we analyze equal protection cases. It's there under the hood, but the Court has developed a series of rules for expressing that balancing test in terms of levels of scrutiny. 

Right now we'll only cover one of them. "**Strict scrutiny**" is what the Court applies to suspect classifications. Strict scrutiny is something we'll see come up again and again in this course in various forms, and across different doctrines, but for now just think of it as how we are to evaluate race discrimination cases.^[Foreshadowing: semi-suspect classifications, like gender, get "intermediate scrutiny." Everything else gets "rational basis scrutiny."]

When we apply strict scrutiny, we have to ask two questions. First, **what's the government interest at stake**? To satisfy strict scrutiny, it has to be "**compelling**." 

How do we know what's a compelling interest? Well, there are some obvious ones --- national security, for example. But beyond that, a compelling interest is kind of what five justices think is a compelling interest---we'll think about this at quite some depth. One important subtlety is that the government doesn't get to make up a compelling interest after the fact: there has to be some reason to think that the compelling interest or interests that justify the classification were actually behind the classification in the first place.

Second, is the government action "**narrowly tailored**" to achieve that compelling interest? Sometimes narrow tailoring is also described as "the least restrictive means," but the two formulations basically mean the same thing: the government action has to be a very close match to the compelling interest. That has two implications: first, the government action can't engage in any more classification than is necessary to serve the compelling interest. If there's a way to achieve the compelling interest without classifying, or with less classification, then the government has to take it. Second, the government action has to actually serve the compelling interest. In other words, it has to be effective.

Importantly, the burden is on the government to show all of this. So typically, strict scrutiny means its very probable that the government will lose.

How does this work in terms of the balancing principle I described above? Well, note how we're still balancing the government's interests against the nastiness of the kind of classification. It's just that the nastiness of the classification comes into the balance in the choice of a level of scrutiny. For really nasty kinds of classification, like race, we choose the highest level of scrutiny, strict scrutiny, and hence choose a rule that requires a really close match to a really important government of interest to balance it. For less nasty kinds of classification, we choose a lower level of scrutiny.

So that's the long start to an even longer tour of how equal protection works. You'll notice from looking at the syllabus that we spend several weeks thinking about the equal protection clause and race. The reason is that we're going to go back to the beginning and loop over all these ideas again in the course of digging deep into the cases. So the first couple cases we read aren't going to be using the levels of scrutiny framework, but we're going to see how it develops, and we're also going to see, through reading the cases, a lot of the subtlties of how this whole mess works, and a lot of the ambiguities in it. So let's go!

## Summary of strict scrutiny

- Government must have a **compelling interest**

- The compelling interest has to be government’s **actual motivation**, not something that is made up after the fact/for purposes of litigation (there are difficult evidentiary questions here)

- The classification must be **narrowly tailored** to achieve that interest 

- That means the classification must be *necessary* to achieve that interest, there can’t be a way to do it without the classification, and, the classification must be effective (to what extent? It’s not clear) at achieving that interest.

- The government *bears the burden of proof* to show that something meets strict scrutiny. 

*Rule of thumb: in strict scrutiny cases, government has an uphill battle/is quite likely to lose (but not always!)*

# Exercise: Prison Segregation

You’re a young lawyer in the Iowa Attorney General’s office. One morning, the warden for the state’s largest prison shows up and tells you that s/he has a serious problem with racial violence: the prisoners form into racist gangs and fight with one another, and several have been killed. 

In order to solve the problem, the warden would like to build segregated dining and recreation areas. Each major racial grouping will have one such area, and prisoners will be required to attend the area consistent with their race. For present purposes, we can assume that every prisoner has a clear and accepted racial identity. 

The warden is worried that this policy will be subject to challenge under the Equal Protection Clause. You’ve been asked to render your advice. 

Working in a group of 3-4 people, come up with the best arguments you can, both for and against the constitutionality of the policy. Please conduct this exercise both under the theory of why segregation is unconstitutional given in Brown v. Board of Education and under current Equal Protection doctrine (to the extent you think they are different), as explained in the videos and materials for this section of the course. If the arguments depend on unknown factual questions, please identify what those questions are and make explicit assumptions about them. Finally, please come to a conclusion about which argument is best, but be prepared to defend either position.

# Exercise: Racial School Acceptance

The City of Liberalland allows students to attend any high school in the district. However, some schools are particularly popular, because parents think they provide a particularly good education, and so they quickly fill up.

Rather than simply accept students to the popular schools by lottery, Liberalland, concerned with counteracting the lingering effect of residential segregation, decides to organize a racially based acceptance plan. When more students wish to attend a school than there are available spaces, the district checks the racial mixture of the school. If it does not match the racial mixture of the population in the whole school district, the district accepts students from the most underrepresented race, then the second most underrepresented race, and so forth.

Unsurprisingly, someone with standing files suit. What result?


\newpage

# Exercise: Laundry

The city of Jerkville passes a law granting a Board of City Planners the discretion to permit or deny licenses for dry cleaners in wooden buildings. The stated justification for this law is that dry cleaners pose an increased risk of fire in those buildings.

As it turns out, one racial group predominantly owns dry cleaners in wooden buildings, and the Board of City Planners denies licenses to all of the people from that racial group, while permitting people from other racial groups to operate dry cleaners in those buildings.

Unsurprisingly, someone with standing files suit. What result? 

\newpage

# Exercise: Pittstroit

The city of Pittstroit is a decaying industrial town whose core industries have long ago been shipped overseas. Its economic collapse was accompanied by increasing residential racial as well as class segregation, as upper-income whites largely fled to the wealthier outskirts and lower-income minorities remained in the central city. The central city has fallen further behind economically, and has begun to experience many of the standard problems of economically declining areas: high crime, poor health, expensive public benefits burdens, lack of transit, etc. As a result, public budgets of the entire urban area have become strained, and the wealthier and whiter residents of the outskirts have found themselves paying higher taxes for services to the central city. More upsetting to them, their children are attending the same schools as academically underperforming students from impoverished backgrounds, in an underfunded citywide school district.

Accordingly, the residents of the outskirts have petitioned the state legislature to permit them to incorporate as independent municipalities, with their own tax bases and school districts. The legislature has enacted a bill permitting the incorporation.

The leader of a local civil rights group has appeared in your office. According to her organization, the anticipated result of this municipal incorporation would be that the municipalities on the outskirts would have schools that are substantially whiter and substantially better-funded than before; the remainder of the city in the middle would have schools with a substantially greater minority population and, unsurprisingly, those schools would also suffer a substantial decline in resources. Lots of other disparaties would be created too, but her organization is focused on education.

Based on the cases we've read thus far, and assuming there's a plaintiff with standing, does her organization have a basis for challenging the municipal incorporation under the Equal Protection Clause? 

The organization has extensive investigative resources, so if there are particular kinds of evidence that need to be developed in order to provide a factual grounding for such a challenge, she'd probably appreciate it if you told her where to look.

# Exercise: Affirmative Action

The University of Liberalland (U of L) is the state's flagship university, and has very high admissions standards. However, it has many more students who apply each year than meet its standards. Its medical school, in particular, is very prestigious and accepts far fewer students each year than it would like to, were teaching resources unlimited.

Recently, several studies have been published suggesting that medical care for patients from disadvantaged groups is significantly enhanced by having doctors who are members of those groups, and who can empathize with the difficulties experienced by those communities. As it turns out, Liberalland has several major urban areas with lower-income, racially segregated, inner cities, and with distinctive health problems rooted in the conditions of those areas (crime, lack of access to healthy food, mold/lead poisoning and other housing deficiencies, the physical consequences of stress from racial discrimination, etc.), and doctors from U of L often end up working in hospitals that serve those areas.

You're the general counsel of the U of L. The dean of the medical school comes to you to ask your advice about several potential policies to better serve these communities. These include:

- Creating a special admissions track for students who are from the economic, racial, and geographic backgrounds reflected in the above-noted areas (ERGB students).

- Funding special scholarships for ERGB students who commit to working in the relevant areas.

- Randomly selecting the class from among qualified applicants, in the hopes that this policy will increase the representation of ERGB students.

- Randomly selecting the class, but reshuffling and re-picking if a given randomly selected class does not have a sufficiently large number of ERGB students.

Advise the dean as to whether any of these policies, or any other policies which you may come up with, are constitutionally permissible.

# Equal Protection part II: Gender, intermediate scrutiny

Now we're moving to our second broad Equal Protection topic, intermediate scrutiny and sex and gender classifications. This is actually going to run a lot shorter than our first topic, but not because it's less important. Rather, it will run shorter because the basic logical structure is the same, only the details of the standard differ, and there are some new questions that are hard to answer. But most of your understanding of race cases can transpose directly to sex and gender cases.^[n.b. I say "sex/gender" classifications, and otherwise use them interchangeably, but theorists who study the subject usually say that "sex" refers to a biological classification, and "gender" to a social role, and that they come apart.]

Incidentally, intermediate scrutiny also applies to "legitimacy," that is, whether someone's parents were married. But this is pretty rare.

## Intermediate scrutiny

The key difference between race and sex/gender is the notion of intermediate scrutiny. Like strict scrutiny, the burden of proof is on the government, and like strict scrutiny, you can't use after-the-fact invented justifications.

The big difference, however, is in the actual level of scrutiny applied. Where for strict scrutiny, the government needs a **compelling** interest, in intermediate scrutiny the government merely needs an **important** interest. And where for strict scrutiny, the classification has to be **narrowly tailored** to the interest, in intermediate scrutiny the classification must only be **substantially related** to the interest.

What does that mean in practice? Well, the difference between important interests and compelling interests isn't particularly clear. It's not like we usually see pairs of cases where the same interest was proffered for both race and sex discrimination, and the government won on sex but not on race. Every compelling interest presumably is also an important interest, but not every important interest need be a compelling one. But I can't just list things that important interests but not compelling interests.

### Compensatory remedies for women but not for people of color??

There is one possibly bizarre corner of the rule. It turns out, probably (based on some old cases that may not survive if it ever comes up in the Roberts court), that the government is allowed to be more solicitous of the subordinated when it comes to gender than when it comes to race. That is, broad social remedial purposes are permissible under intermediate scrutiny, but not strict scrutiny: the government can take the initiative to remedy social gender-based injustice. Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), discusses this at length, although doesn't apply it; earlier cases that did apply it, and which O'Connor cites, include Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977), and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.S. 498 (1975). It's easiest just to quote her directly:

> It is readily apparent that a State can evoke a compensatory purpose to justify an otherwise discriminatory classification only if members of the gender benefited by the classification actually suffer a disadvantage related to the classification. We considered such a situation in Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 313 (1977), which involved a challenge to a statutory classification that allowed women to eliminate more low-earning years than men for purposes of computing Social Security retirement benefits. Although the effect of the classification was to allow women higher monthly benefits than were available to men with the same earning history, we upheld the statutory scheme, noting that it took into account that women "as such have been unfairly hindered from earning as much as men" and "work[ed] directly to remedy" the resulting economic disparity. 

> A similar pattern of discrimination against women influenced our decision in Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra. There, we considered a federal statute that granted female Naval officers a 13-year tenure of commissioned service before mandatory discharge, but accorded male officers only a 9-year tenure. We recognized that, because women were barred from combat duty, they had had fewer opportunities for promotion than had their male counterparts. By allowing women an additional four years to reach a particular rank before subjecting them to mandatory discharge, the statute directly compensated for other statutory barriers to advancement.

But we know from, e.g., *Parents Involved*, that this isn't permissible in the case of race.  What gives?  This seems kind of perverse:  Remedying social injustice against racial minorities isn't a compelling interest, but remedying social injustice against women is an important interest? 

To be clear: the perversity follows from the fact that this outcome seems to fly in the face of the original purpose as well as key normative meaning of the Reconstruction amendments.  The 14th Amendment is supposed, if we're originalist at all, to provide the strongest protection to that racially defined class of people who have been victimized by the legacy of slavery. So if the levels of scrutiny framework means that it forbids government action to actually make up for some of the wrongs committed against that group, while permitting the government to make up for wrongs committed against another group who were not intended to be the original beneficiaries of the amendment's protection, that seems ludicrous.

Here's an argument to potentially justify this difference.  I don't necessarily endorse it, but it's worth considering: the cases striking down remedial purposes tend to mostly strike down state action; the cases upholding remedial purposes tend to mostly uphold federal action.  Thus, an alternative way to read these cases, although one that requires being a little aggressive in one's interpretation of the corpus, is to say that the federal government just has broader remedial power over social injustice than the states do, because a) the enforcement clauses of the reconstruction amendments arguably grant Congress explicit remedial powers plus because b) after all, the whole point of them was as part and parcel of a federal effort to remedy state discrimination and regularize the status of an egregiously oppressed group of people, and c) let's not forget that the equal protection clause, technically speaking, doesn't even apply to the federal government: it was reverse-incorporated through the 5th Amendment's due process clause in Bolling v. Sharpe, but it doesn't have to be the case that the standards are exactly the same. Anyway, one occasionally hears arguments along these lines.

What about substantial relatedness? People typically say that the classification can be a little overinclusive or underinclusive. Another way to think about substantial relatedness is that the government doesn't have to do as little gender classification as humanly possible the way it would with race. But its gender classification does still have to be pretty important for the goals it's pursuing.

### Why intermediate scrutiny?

In view of the fact that there has been a massive history of discrimination against women, why not just apply strict scrutiny to sex/gender classifiations?  A number of possible justifications come to mind:

- Originalism: the 14th amendment was actually aimed at race, so it ought to have the strictest standard. Potential counterargument: we apply strict scrutiny to categories other than race, most notably alienage. See generally Bernal v. Fainter, 467 U.S. 216 (1984).

- Carolene Products: although there's a history of official discrimination against women as well as lots of present social discrimination, women at least in principle are less politically vulnerable than racial minorities, since, after all, women make up a numerical majority of the population. So the need for constitutional protection is perhaps somewhat lesser.

- Historical: Congress tried to enact an equal rights amendment specifically providing for equal rights for women. It didn't get ratified by enough states. Arguably, that failure makes it less democratically legitimate to turn around and apply strict scrutiny to sex/gender classifications.

- Pragmatic: there are some actual meaningful biological differences that more-or-less track sex lines (like reproductive role, obviously); the same cannot be said for race, according to most credible scientists. So maybe that justifies being a little less cautious about sex classifications ---although the answer to this justification might be "well, that doesn't preclude strict scrutiny, because consideration of biological differences could come in on the narrow tailoring prong."

## What counts as sex/gender discrimination?

Because lots of other characteristics are linked to sex and gender, it cannot be obvious what sorts of things constitute sex/gender discrimination.  In particular, here are two things that might count, but do not do so under current doctrine:

- *Sexual orientation*.  You might argue that sexual orientation discrimination is just a form of discrimination based on the relationship between a person's sex/gender and the sex/gender of their preferred partner(s). For some reason, however, the Court has never held this.

- *Pregnancy*.  You might think that since only women can become pregnant, and sex difference is (arguably) defined by biological reproductive role, discrimination against the pregnant constitutes discrimination against women.  well... I've got some bad news for you. In *Geduldig v. Aiello*, 417 U.S. 484 (1974), the Court held that pregnancy discrimination was not the same as sex discrimination, and hence not subject to any kind of heightened scrutiny.

*Geduldig* is worth exploring a little bit further. The case arose in the context of California's disability insurance system for employees who were temporarily disabled from working. The insurance benefits excluded "disability resulting from an individual’s court commitment as a dipsomaniac, drug addict, or sexual psychopath," as well as "normal pregnancies" (as opposed to, for example, unusually injurious pregnancies). 

You might think that since only women can get pregnant, excluding pregnancy, .  Sure, there's a sense in which pregnancy is a voluntary disability, since it's the result of the person's own choices---but so are lots of other disabilities that would be covered by the insurance. If an extreme sports afficionado gets temporarily disabled because of a parkour/base jumping injury, for example, they'd get covered. 

But the Court said that this wasn't sex discrimination.  Here are the relevant parts:

> The program does not discriminate with respect to the persons or groups eligible for its protection, and there is no evidence that it discriminates against any definable group or class in terms of the aggregate risk protection derived from the program

> The dissenting opinion to the contrary, this case is thus a far cry from cases like Reed v. Reed, and Frontiero v. Richardson, involving discrimination based upon gender as such. The California insurance program does not exclude anyone from benefit eligibility because of gender, but merely removes one physical condition -- pregnancy -- from the list of compensable disabilities. While it is true that only women can become pregnant, it does not follow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification like those considered in Reed and Frontiero. Normal pregnancy is an objectively identifiable physical condition with unique characteristics. Absent a showing that distinctions involving pregnancy are mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination against the members of one sex or the other, lawmakers are constitutionally free to include or exclude pregnancy from the coverage of legislation such as this on any reasonable basis, just as with respect to any other physical condition.

> The lack of identity between the excluded disability and gender as such under this insurance program becomes clear upon the most cursory analysis. The program divides potential recipients into two groups -- pregnant women and nonpregnant persons. While the first group is exclusively female, the second includes members of both sexes. The fiscal and actuarial benefits of the program thus accrue to members of both sexes.

> Indeed, the appellant submitted to the District Court data that indicated that both the annual claim rate and the annual claim cost are greater for women than for men. As the District Court acknowledged, "women contribute about 28 percent of the total disability insurance fund and receive back about 38 percent of the fund in benefits."  Several amici curiae have represented to the Court that they have had a similar experience under private disability insurance programs.

Under the rational basis test, which we'll discuss down the line, California's decision clearly passes muster, as the Court notes. The budget was just about balanced, and, obviously, lots of people miss work for pregnancies: to require California to cover loss of work for pregnancy would have either totally busted the budget or required a massive (and regressive) raise in premiums paid by employees for the program, and defeat the state's goals. 

Here are some things you might think about this case: 

- Is the Court perhaps operating under a Washington v. Davis kind of intuition: this is really just a kind of disparate impact? 

- But is that idea fundamentally silly?  It's not incidental that excluding pregnancy only has an impact on women, it's built directly into the nature of exclusion: the capacity to become pregnant is part of the concept of human femaleness. It's not facially neutral. Come on. 
 
- Suppose we changed the hypo to get rid of the actuarial benefits to non-pregnant woman which the opinion mentioned?   For example, suppose the stage forbids pregnant women from working certain jobs deemed dangerous to the fetus? Here, there isn't this same kind of sex-neutral financial benefit, the burden falls all on women. Would that be sex discrimination?  Or would the reasoning of *Geduldig* still apply?

## Closing notes

There are some interesting refinements that we'll see when we look at the VMI case, mainly related to the question of whether the government can rely on statistical generalizations about men and women. Other than that, since we're doing sex/gender quickly in this course, it behooves me to point you to the other important cases cases that people tend to assign when it gets longer treatment:

- *Nguyen v. Ins*, 533 U.S. 53 (2001) (additional proof of parentage requirements for citizenship of U.S. citizen father rather than U.S. citizen mother passes intermediate scrutiny) (see also Parham v. Hughes, 441 U.S. 347 (1979) for similar rule upheld re: wrongful death suits)

- *Michael M. v. Superior Court*, 450 U.S. 464 (1981) (statutory rape law allegedly penalizing only men [but, actually, as written, only penalizing sex with women---heteronormative much, Justice Rehnquist?] constitutional)

- *Rostker v. Goldberg*, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) (a really weird case: exempting women from the draft permissible because women were excluded from combat---the government's own prior discrimination was given as the substantial interest for the government's discrimination.)

- *Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney*, 442 U.S. 256 (1979) (Washington v. Davis, but for sex).

- *Craig v. Boren*, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) (case establishing intermediate scrutiny standard, different drinking age for men and for women unconstitutional even though there was a statistical relationship between gender and getting caught DUI---particularly important, had we more time I would have assigned it; highly recommended reading. also contains very important concurrence by Stevens giving his critique of the whole levels of scrutiny framework)

- *Frontiero v. Richardson*, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (plurality flirts with strict scrutiny, strikes down gender-based distinction in military spousal dependent benefits---also we get to see Potter Stewart singlehandedly messing up equal protection law by concurring without an opinion rather than giving the plurality a majority---had he signed on, would we have strict scrutiny today? perhaps.)

- *Reed v. Reed*, 404 U.S. 71 (1971) (law preferring men to women as probate administrators unanimously struck down)

# Exercise: Senior Executive Service

The President of the United States has issued the following executive order: 

> In the judgment of the President, pernicious gender-based socialization processes have impaired the capacity of the executive branch to function most effectively. Men, who are typically socialized from a very young age in our culture to be more confident and outgoing, tend to be promoted beyond their actual talents over women, who are typically socialized from a young age to be more humble and modest. Moreover, women have typically been socialized to display a more empathetic leadership style, which has been shown to be the most productive in high-level executive positions. 

> Accordingly, all executive departments are instructed to prefer women for all roles in the Senior Executive Service [the federal classification for the highest-level civil service appointments]. In situation where the evaluation criteria for a position uses numerical scores, women are to be preferred to a degree equivalent to ten points on a scale of 100. In a situation where the evaluation criteria for a position are more subjective, where otherwise equally qualified men and women are available, selection must be made from the available women.


A man who was rejected from a position in the Senior Executive Service in favor of a woman has filed suit, challenging this order under the Equal Protection Clause. As usual, you're a clerk to the judge in whose lap this case has fallen. Your judge has asked you to evaluate this claim, and also to answer the following additional questions: 

1. Does your evaluation depend on whether the position in question was based on numerical scores or subjective evaluation? 

2. Does your evaluation depend on whether or not the executive order includes credible references to the sociological, psychological, and/or gender studies literature substantiating its claims about socialization? 

3. If the policy is unconstitutional, what could the President do to achieve the same goals in a constitutionally permissible way?

# Exercise: Transgender hair

Patricia Plaintiff, a transgender individual who was born with male physical features but who holds a female gender identity, has joined the Iowa National Guard. The Guard has no gender-based regulations on hair length, however, it is customary for female recruits to wear their hair somewhat longer than male recruits, within the overall limitations provided by regulation. In boot camp, Patricia wore her hair at a customary female, rather than male, length.

Her commander, in response to this choice of hair lengths, subjected Patricia to verbal disparagement and a variety of informal sanctions, and ultimately to a less desirable unit assignment upon graduation, because "I don't want to have to see your damn hair every day." At the unit to which she is assigned, Patricia is ordered to live in the men's barracks, over her objections.

Unsurprisingly, Patricia has brought suit, seeking assignment to the more desirable unit and to a woman's barracks on an Equal Protection theory. You are the clerk to the trial judge. Assuming that the court has jurisdiction over these decisions, and that they give rise to a right of action for injunctive relief (in particular, assume that the military context does not compromise the court's jurisdiction or remedial power), advise your judge on the standard under which Patricia's claims are to be considered, and the result that ought to be reached.

# Equal Protection 3: Rational Basis

As we know by now, rational basis is the default rule for if we don't have some other standard of review that applies. And rational basis is *extremely deferential*. The court will uphold a law under rational basis if it's **rationally related** to a **legitimate** government interest.

|Standard of review|Importance of government interest|Relationship|Core Classification|
|Strict Scrutiny|Compelling Interest|Narrowly Tailored|Race (suspect classifications)|
|Intermediate Scrutiny|Important Interest|Substantially Related|Sex/Gender (semi-suspect classifications)|
|Rational Basis|Legitimate Interest|Rationally Related|Catch-all|

## Rational basis is easy

Rational basis is easy. Basically, the government almost always wins. And, in particular, you know how things like "administrative convenience" don't really work for strict scrutiny, and probably don't work for intermediate scrutiny? They'll probably work quite fine for rational basis scrutiny.

Most importantly, the burden of proof and treatment of after-acquired (cooked up for litigation) reasons shifts when we get to rational basis. As you know, with both strict scrutiny and intermediate scrutiny, the government has the burden of showing its classification meets the given interest, and it cannot rely on interests cooked up after the fact for the purposes of litigation; rather, the interests it appeals to have to be the interests that were actually under consideration (in some meaningful sense, given the well-known problems of aggregated legislative motivations and such) when the classification was enacted.

Both of those flip with rational basis. Now the party challenging the law has to prove that the government's classification isn't rationally related to a legitimate interest, and this can include any interest that can justify the classification, regardless of whether it had anything to do with why the classification was enacted in the first place.

So how can the government lose a rational basis case? Well, for the most part, it has to be either acting totally arbitrarily or irrationally---in a "class of one" kind of case where someone alleges that they've been treated differently for no reason at all. For example, the claim at issue in *Village of Willowbrook v. Olech*---remember that? We talked about it before, a plaintiff who claimed that the city, for no reason, demanded a water line easement on her property twice as large as everyone else's. That might be the kind of claim that falls under rational basis, if there is just no reason for the double-size easement. We might also see this in cases where some individual government employee just abuses someone out of a personal dislike, either on an individual basis or on a non-suspect group basis---if the tax assessor doubles your assessed tax rate because you're a redhead and he, like Cartman, thinks "gingers have no souls."

## Animus, Rational basis with "bite"

This personal dislike idea is at the heart of the places where rational basis actually seems to lead to state action getting struck down in real cases: when it looks like the government is just acting out of distaste toward a particular class of people. Of course, this shows up particularly in the gay rights context, and soon we'll read Romer v. Evans and think carefully about what it means to attribute this kind of animus to the government, and whether the idea is useful.

Related to the animus idea is a concept known as "rational basis with bite." The thing about rational basis with bite is that it doesn't exist, at least not officially. Some scholars, and occasionally a lower court, will talk about "rational basis with bite" to mean that the court nominally applies rational basis to state action taken against certain disadvantaged groups ---the disabled, gays and lesbians---but really applies something stricter.

A key example is *Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center*, 473 U.S. 432 (1985). The city of Cleburne imposed special zoning requirements on a group home for citizens with cognitive disabilities and denied them a permit. The Supreme Court rejected the court of appeals's attempt to treat mental disability as a quasi-suspect classification, but nonetheless struck down the permit denial in question. The decision primarily focused on the fact that the city's asserted justifications for the law all depended on fears and stereotypes about the mentally disabled: that nearby property owners wouldn't want to be around them, that nearby junior high school students might harass them. What's striking about Cleburne is that the court was not very deferential to the city's reasoning process at all: it completely cast aside the city's notion that housing the mentally disabled would be different from other kinds of group housing that were not subject to these special demands, such as housing for the elderly. Which, let's face it, was correct in a rational sense--the city's ruling does seem to have actually been based on stereotypes about the mentally disabled, at least to hear the court tell it---but doesn't really feel like rational basis review.

A similar example is *Plyler v. Doe*, 457 U.S. 202 (1981), which struck down a Texas law denying an education to undocumented immigrant children. Here's what Justice Brennan said for the court there (I've edited it quite a bit):

> Appellants argue that the classification at issue furthers an interest in the "preservation of the state's limited resources for the education of its lawful residents. Of course, a concern for the preservation of resources, standing alone, can hardly justify the classification used in allocating those resources. The State must do more than justify its classification with a concise expression of an intention to discriminate. Apart from the asserted state prerogative to act against undocumented children solely on the basis of their undocumented status -- an asserted prerogative that carries only minimal force in the circumstances of these cases -- we discern three colorable state interests that might support [the law]. 

> First, appellants appear to suggest that the State may seek to protect itself from an influx of illegal immigrants. While a State might have an interest in mitigating the potentially harsh economic effects of sudden shifts in population, [the law] hardly offers an effective method of dealing with an urgent demographic or economic problem. There is no evidence in the record suggesting that illegal entrants impose any significant burden on the State's economy. To the contrary, the available evidence suggests that illegal aliens underutilize public services, while contributing their labor to the local economy and tax money to the state fisc. 

> Second... appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out for exclusion because of the special burdens they impose on the State's ability to provide high-quality public education. But the record in no way supports the claim that exclusion of undocumented children is likely to improve the overall quality of education in the State. As the District Court noted, the State failed to offer any credible supporting evidence that a proportionately small diminution of the funds spent on each child which might result from devoting some state funds to the education of the excluded group will have a grave impact on the quality of education. ... Of course, even if improvement in the quality of education were a likely result of barring some number of children from the schools of the State, the State must support its selection of this group as the appropriate target for exclusion. 

> Finally, appellants suggest that undocumented children are appropriately singled out because their unlawful presence within the United States renders them less likely than other children to remain within the boundaries of the State, and to put their education to productive social or political use within the State. Even assuming that such an interest is legitimate, it is an interest that is most difficult to quantify. The State has no assurance that any child, citizen or not, will employ the education provided by the State within the confines of the State's borders.

Again, this decision seems right as a matter of morality and policy, but it doesn't look like the rational basis review Justice Brennan claimed it was. Notice, in particular, how he demands the state prove that its cost-saving measure will improve education. But wait a minute, wasn't the burden in rational basis supposed to be on the challenger? Brennan also went on talking about a "substantial state interest" rather than the usual "legitimate state interest."

Another example, along similar lines, is *USDA v. Moreno*, 413 U.S. 528 (1973). There, the court, again via Justice Brennan, struck down limitation of food stamp assistance to related, not unrelated, people living together. The government had claimed that it was justifiable because Congress could have thought unrelated households are more likely to be committing welfare fraud. The court barely discussed that justification, essentially dismissing it out of hand.

And then, of course, there are the gay rights cases. So what do we make of this? On balance, it's probably fair to say that if it looks like the state is picking on some group, where it looks like that group is disadvantaged and it looks like the decision is rooted in stereotypes and prejudice---undocumented immigrants, food stamp recipients, the disabled, gays and lesbians---even though that group isn't picked out by some suspect or semi-suspect classification, there's some chance that instead of choosing to create a new semi-suspect classification, the court will just quietly apply a rougher rational basis standard than usual.

That takes us to our final point about rational basis. Because it's the default rule, people who are trying to win greater protection for some group or another often show and ask the Court to hold that a given classification ought to be added to the list of suspect or semi-suspect classifications. And they typically lose: they lost with disability, with socioeconomic class, and, to this day, the Court still hasn't held that sexual orientation is a semi-suspect class, even as it just recently struck down the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples on a fundamental rights theory (about which more in the next module). We'll read the most important failed attempt on Monday, in the form of San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez. Onward.
