# Katzenbach v. Morgan

384 U.S. 641 (1966)

**Mr. Justice BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.**

These cases concern the constitutionality of § 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act
of 1965. That law, in the respects pertinent in these cases, provides that no
person who has successfully completed the sixth primary grade in a public
school in, or a private school accredited by, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico
in which the language of instruction was other than English shall be denied
the right to vote in any election because of his inability to read or write
English. Appellees, registered voters in New York City, brought this suit to
challenge the constitutionality of § 4(e) insofar as it pro tanto prohibits
the enforcement of the election laws of New York requiring an ability to read
and write English as a condition of voting. Under these laws many of the
several hundred thousand New York City residents who have migrated there from
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had previously been denied the right to vote,
and appellees attack § 4(e) insofar as it would enable many of these citizens
to vote.

We hold that, in the application challenged
in these cases, § 4(e) is a proper exercise of the powers granted to Congress
by § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment5 and that by force of the Supremacy Clause,
Article VI, the New York English literacy requirement cannot be enforced to
the extent that it is inconsistent with § 4(e).

Under the distribution of powers effected by the Constitution, the States
establish qualifications for voting for state officers, and the qualifications
established by the States for voting for members of the most numerous branch
of the state legislature also determine who may vote for United States
Representatives and Senators, Art. I, § 2; Seventeenth Amendment. But, of course, the
States have no power to grant or withhold the franchise on conditions that are
forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the
Constitution. Such exercises of state power are no more immune to the
limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment than any other state action. The Equal
Protection Clause itself has been held to forbid some state laws that restrict
the right to vote.

The Attorney General of the State of New York argues that an exercise of
congressional power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment that prohibits the
enforcement of a state law can only be sustained if the judicial branch
determines that the state law is prohibited by the provisions of the Amendment
that Congress sought to enforce. More specifically, he urges that § 4(e)
cannot be sustained as appropriate legislation to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause unless the judiciary decides--even with the guidance of a congressional
judgment--that the application of the English literacy requirement prohibited
by § 4(e) is forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause itself. We disagree.
Neither the language nor history of § 5 supports such a construction. As was
said with regard to § 5 in Ex parte Com. of Virginia, 'It is the power of Congress which has been enlarged. Congress is authorized to enforce the prohibitions by appropriate legislation. Some
legislation is contemplated to make the amendments fully effective.' A
construction of § 5 that would require a judicial determination that the
enforcement of the state law precluded by Congress violated the Amendment, as
a condition of sustaining the congressional enactment, would depreciate both
congressional resourcefulness and congressional responsibility for
implementing the Amendment. It would confine the legislative power in this
context to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the
judicial branch was prepared to adjudge unconstitutional, or of merely
informing the judgment of the judiciary by particularizing the 'majestic
generalities' of § 1 of the Amendment. 

Thus our task in this case is not to determine whether the New York English
literacy requirement as applied to deny the right to vote to a person who
successfully completed the sixth grade in a Puerto Rican school violates the
Equal Protection Clause. [T]he question before us here [is]: Without regard to whether the judiciary
would find that the Equal Protection Clause itself nullifies New York's
English literacy requirement as so applied, could Congress prohibit the
enforcement of the state law by legislating under § 5 of the Fourteenth
Amendment? In answering this question, our task is limited to determining
whether such legislation is, as required by § 5, appropriate legislation to
enforce the Equal Protection Clause.

By including § 5 the draftsmen sought to grant to Congress, by a specific
provision applicable to the Fourteenth Amendment, the same broad powers
expressed in the Necessary and Proper Clause. The
classic formulation of the reach of those powers was established by Chief
Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland:

> Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.

Ex parte Com. of Virginia, decided 12 years after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, held that congressional power under § 5 had this same broad scope:

> Whatever legislation is appropriate, that is, adapted to carry out the objects the amendments have in view, whatever tends to enforce submission to the prohibitions they contain, and to secure to all persons the enjoyment of perfect equality of civil rights and the equal protection of the laws against State denial or invasion, if not prohibited, is brought within the domain of congressional power.' 

Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment grants Congress a similar power to enforce by 'appropriate
legislation' the provisions of that amendment; and we recently held in State
of South Carolina v. Katzenbach that '(t)he basic test to be applied in a case involving § 2 of
the Fifteenth Amendment is the same as in all cases concerning the express
powers of Congress with relation to the reserved powers of the States.' That
test was identified as the one formulated in McCulloch v. Maryland.  Thus the McCulloch v. Maryland standard is the measure of what constitutes 'appropriate legislation' under § 5 of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Correctly viewed, § 5 is a positive grant of legislative
power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining whether
and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

We therefore proceed to the consideration whether § 4(e) is 'appropriate
legislation' to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, that is, under the
McCulloch v. Maryland standard, whether § 4(e) may be regarded as an enactment
to enforce the Equal Protection Clause, whether it is 'plainly adapted to that
end' and whether it is not prohibited by but is consistent with 'the letter
and spirit of the constitution.'

There can be no doubt that § 4(e) may be regarded as an enactment to enforce
the Equal Protection Clause. Congress explicitly declared that it enacted §
4(e) 'to secure the rights under the fourteenth amendment of persons educated
in American-flag schools in which the predominant classroom language was other
than English.' The persons referred to include those who have migrated from
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to New York and who have been denied the right
to vote because of their inability to read and write English, and the
Fourteenth Amendment rights referred to include those emanating from the Equal
Protection Clause. More specifically, § 4(e) may be viewed as a measure to
secure for the Puerto Rican community residing in New York nondiscriminatory
treatment by government--both in the imposition of voting qualifications and
the provision or administration of governmental services, such as public
schools, public housing and law enforcement.

Section 4(e) may be readily seen as 'plainly adapted' to furthering these aims
of the Equal Protection Clause. The practical effect of § 4(e) is to prohibit
New York from denying the right to vote to large segments of its Puerto Rican
community. Congress has thus prohibited the State from denying to that
community the right that is 'preservative of all rights.' This enhanced political
power will be helpful in gaining nondiscriminatory treatment in public
services for the entire Puerto Rican community. Section 4(e) thereby enables
the Puerto Rican minority better to obtain 'perfect equality of civil rights
and the equal protection of the laws.' It was well within congressional
authority to say that this need of the Puerto Rican minority for the vote
warranted federal intrusion upon any state interests served by the English
literacy requirement. It was for Congress, as the branch that made this
judgment, to assess and weigh the various conflicting considerations--the risk
or pervasiveness of the discrimination in governmental services, the
effectiveness of eliminating the state restriction on the right to vote as a
means of dealing with the evil, the adequacy or availability of alternative
remedies, and the nature and significance of the state interests that would be
affected by the nullification of the English literacy requirement as applied
to residents who have successfully completed the sixth grade in a Puerto Rican
school. It is not for us to review the congressional resolution of these
factors. It is enough that we be able to perceive a basis upon which the
Congress might resolve the conflict as it did. There plainly was such a basis
to support § 4(e) in the application in question in this case. Any contrary
conclusion would require us to be blind to the realities familiar to the
legislators.

The result is no different if we confine our inquiry to the question whether §
4(e) was merely legislation aimed at the elimination of an invidious
discrimination in establishing voter qualifications. We are told that New
York's English literacy requirement originated in the desire to provide an
incentive for non-English speaking immigrants to learn the English language
and in order to assure the intelligent exercise of the franchise. Yet Congress
might well have questioned, in light of the many exemptions provided, and
some evidence suggesting that prejudice played a prominent role in the
enactment of the requirement, whether these were actually the interests
being served. Congress might have also questioned whether denial of a right
deemed so precious and fundamental in our society was a necessary or
appropriate means of encouraging persons to learn English, or of furthering
the goal of an intelligent exercise of the franchise. Finally, Congress
might well have concluded that as a means of furthering the intelligent
exercise of the franchise, an ability to read or understand Spanish is as
effective as ability to read English for those to whom Spanish-language
newspapers and Spanish-language radio and television programs are available to
inform them of election issues and governmental affairs. Since Congress
undertook to legislate so as to preclude the enforcement of the state law, and
did so in the context of a general appraisal of literacy requirements for
voting, see State of South Carolina v. Katzenbach, to which it brought
a specially informed legislative competence, it was Congress' prerogative to
weigh these competing considerations. Here again, it is enough that we
perceive a basis upon which Congress might predicate a judgment that the
application of New York's English literacy requirement to deny the right to
vote to a person with a sixth grade education in Puerto Rican schools in which
the language of instruction was other than English constituted an invidious
discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
