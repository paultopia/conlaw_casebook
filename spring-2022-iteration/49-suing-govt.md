 # Final Note: Suing the Government

The last thing I want to make sure you have some exposure to, even though it's not explicitly part of the subject matter of the course, is some clue about how you get an individual rights constitutional challenge into court.

Of course, if your client is being criminally prosecuted, that's easy: you raise the constitutional challenge as a defense. But sometimes your client isn't likely to be subject to prosecution, or you want to raise the challenge in a less risky environment. (If your client waits to bring the challenge until they're subject to prosecution, then they if they lose they go to prison!)

Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Agents found an implied constitutional tort against federal officials who violate constitutional rights. Against state officials, Congress has provided a right of action in 42 U.S.C. 1983.

Section 1983 litigation is very complicated, you could teach a large part of a class on it (and I used to practice in the area), but the main issue revolves around "qualified immunity." The short version is that an official isn't liable for damages unless the right she or he violated is "clearly established," which basically means there has to be governing authority with pretty similar facts if you want damages. Lots of police have gotten away with lots of constitutional violations under qualified immunity doctrine.

There's lots of other complexity with respect to sovereign immunity, which parties to name in the suit, official vs individual capacity suits, claims for injunctions vs claims for damages, etc. I can't teach you all that stuff (and I'd have to go refresh my memory on some of the fine details anyway), but I at least want to flag these things for you so that you know they exist before you run out and start filing constitutional lawsuits.
