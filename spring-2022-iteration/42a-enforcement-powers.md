# Civil rights enforcement powers


The three Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, 15th) are *primarily* individual rights amendments, and their individual rights components constitute the majority of the attention they typically get in a constitutional law class.  However, you'll notice when you reread them (you should reread them) that they also authorize Congressional action.

In fact, those three amendments radically reshaped the balance between state and federal power. Let us recall the history: part of the claim of the south in the civil was was that their "state's rights" (to enslave people) were under threat. When they got beat, the first thing that Congress (dominated at the time by "Radical Republicans," whom, the historians in the room may recall, were radical mainly because they wanted to compensate the people who had been enslaved for, well, being enslaved. [40 acres and a mule and all that.](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/the-truth-behind-40-acres-and-a-mule/)) wanted to do was weaken their power bases. 

So, naturally, when they amended the Constitution to create individual rights for the freed slaves, they also decided that Congress would get to take charge of implementing those rights. They certainly weren't about to leave it to the states. So each of the Reconstruction Amendments gives Congress the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, its provisions.

This immediately raises a number of mixed federalism/separation of powers questions: 

1.  Enforce against whom?  We typically think that those rights only grant individuals rights *against the government* (e.g., the government can't do race discrimination); but can Congress also make laws prohibiting private citizens from doing things like race discrimination?  (Recall that Congress certainly can do so under the commerce power, at least in economic life, but can it also do so under the 13th, 14th amendments?)

2.  Who gets to decide the content of the rights?  Marbury v. Madison suggests that the Supreme Court gets to decide what individual rights are under these amendments, but does Congress's enforcement power mean that Congress gets to say, for example, "We know the Supreme Court said that act X doesn't violate individual rights under the 14th amendment, but we think it does, so states shall not do it."

So the Congressional enforcement power could mean anything on a spectrum from a maximalist "Congress gets to define these individual rights violations and hold individuals responsible as well as the state," to a minimalist "Congress just gets to provide for some penalties for when states violate them."  

Ultimately, what we get out of the caselaw is something in between: 

- Congress can't reach private action under the 14th and 15th amendments, but it *can* reach private action under the 13th amendment, to prohibit the "badges and incidents of slavery," and can also do things like create causes of action against people who use the state's power (police officers who violate rights, for example).

- Congress cannot expand the scope of constitutional rights against the state, by forbidding things the Supreme Court has said is ok under the 14th amendment. 

- Congress can implement what we might call "remedial" rules, that is, rules that don't directly prohibit what the constitution already prohibits, but do help effectuate that prohibition. (Think of the exclusionary rule in the criminal procedure context.)
