# Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife

504 U.S. 555 (1992)


**Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.**

This case involves a challenge to a rule promulgated by the Secretary of the
Interior interpreting ยง 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) in such fashion as to render it applicable only to actions within the United States or on the high seas. The
preliminary issue, and the only one we reach, is whether the respondents here,
plaintiffs below, have standing to seek judicial review of the rule.

The ESA seeks to protect species of animals against threats to their continuing existence caused by man. The ESA instructs the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate by regulation a list of those species which are either endangered or threatened under enumerated criteria, and to define the critical habitat of these species. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act then provides, in pertinent part:

> Each Federal agency shall, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Secretary [of the Interior], insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation as appropriate with affected States, to be critical.

In 1978, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS) promulgated a joint regulation stating that the
obligations imposed by ยง 7(a)(2) extend to actions taken in foreign nations. The next year, however, the Interior Department began
to reexamine its position. A
revised joint regulation, reinterpreting ยง 7(a)(2) to require consultation
only for actions taken in the United States or on the high seas, was promulgated in 1986.

Shortly thereafter, respondents, organizations dedicated to wildlife
conservation and other environmental causes, filed this action against the
Secretary of the Interior, seeking a declaratory judgment that the new
regulation is in error as to the geographic scope of ยง 7(a)(2), and an
injunction requiring the Secretary to promulgate a new regulation restoring
the initial interpretation. 


Over the years, our cases have established that the irreducible constitutional
minimum of standing contains three elements: First, the plaintiff must have
suffered an "injury in fact"--an invasion of a legally-protected interest
which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) "actual or imminent,
not 'conjectural' or 'hypothetical.' Second, there must be a causal
connection between the injury and the conduct complained of--the injury has to
be "fairly . . . trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and
not . . . th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not
before the court." Third, it must be "likely,"
as opposed to merely "speculative," that the injury will be "redressed by a
favorable decision." 

The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these
elements. Since they are not mere pleading requirements but rather an indispensable part
of the plaintiff's case, each element must be supported in the same way as any
other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with
the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the
litigation. 

When the suit is one challenging the legality of government action or
inaction, the nature and extent of facts that must be averred (at the summary
judgment stage) or proved (at the trial stage) in order to establish standing
depends considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the
action (or forgone action) at issue. If he is, there is ordinarily little
question that the action or inaction has caused him injury, and that a
judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it. When, however, as
in this case, a plaintiff's asserted injury arises from the government's
allegedly unlawful regulation (or lack of regulation) of someone else, much
more is needed. In that circumstance, causation and redressability ordinarily
hinge on the response of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the
government action or inaction and perhaps on the response of others as well.
The existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing "depends on
the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and
whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume
either to control or to predict,"and it
becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices
have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit
redressability of injury. Thus, when the plaintiff is not himself the object of the government
action or inaction he challenges, standing is not precluded, but it is
ordinarily "substantially more difficult" to establish. 

We think the Court of Appeals failed to apply the foregoing principles in
denying the Secretary's motion for summary judgment. Respondents had not made
the requisite demonstration of (at least) injury and redressability.

Respondents' claim to injury is that the lack of consultation with respect to
certain funded activities abroad "increas[es] the rate of extinction of
endangered and threatened species."  Of course, the
desire to use or observe an animal species, even for purely aesthetic
purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest for purpose of standing.  "But the
'injury in fact' test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest.
It requires that the party seeking review be himself among the injured."
 To survive the Secretary's summary judgment motion, respondents had to submit affidavits or other evidence showing, through specific facts, not only that listed species were in fact being threatened by funded activities abroad, but also that one or more of
respondents' members would thereby be "directly" affected apart from their "
'special interest' in th[e] subject." 

With respect to this aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals focused on the
affidavits of two Defenders' members--Joyce Kelly and Amy Skilbred. Ms. Kelly
stated that she traveled to Egypt in 1986 and "observed the traditional
habitat of the endangered nile crocodile there and intend[s] to do so again,
and hope[s] to observe the crocodile directly," and that she "will suffer harm
in fact as a result of [the] American . . . role . . . in overseeing the
rehabilitation of the Aswan High Dam on the Nile . . . and [in] develop[ing] .
. . Egypt's . . . Master Water Plan." Ms. Skilbred averred that she
traveled to Sri Lanka in 1981 and "observed th[e] habitat" of "endangered
species such as the Asian elephant and the leopard" at what is now the site of
the Mahaweli Project funded by the Agency for International Development (AID),
although she "was unable to see any of the endangered species;" "this
development project," she continued, "will seriously reduce endangered,
threatened, and endemic species habitat including areas that I visited . . .
[, which] may severely shorten the future of these species;" that threat, she
concluded, harmed her because she "intend[s] to return to Sri Lanka in the
future and hope[s] to be more fortunate in spotting at least the endangered
elephant and leopard." When Ms. Skilbred was asked at a
subsequent deposition if and when she had any plans to return to Sri Lanka,
she reiterated that "I intend to go back to Sri Lanka," but confessed that she
had no current plans: "I don't know [when]. There is a civil war going on
right now. I don't know. Not next year, I will say. In the future." 

We shall assume for the sake of argument that these affidavits contain facts
showing that certain agency-funded projects threaten listed species--though
that is questionable. They plainly contain no facts, however, showing how
damage to the species will produce "imminent" injury to Mss. Kelly and
Skilbred. That the women "had visited" the areas of the projects before the
projects commenced proves nothing. As we have said in a related context, "
'[p]ast exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or
controversy regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any
continuing, present adverse effects.'"  And the affiants' profession of an "inten[t]" to
return to the places they had visited before--where they will presumably, this
time, be deprived of the opportunity to observe animals of the endangered
species--is simply not enough. Such "some day" intentions--without any
description of concrete plans, or indeed even any specification of when the
some day will be--do not support a finding of the "actual or imminent" injury
that our cases require. 

Besides relying upon the Kelly and Skilbred affidavits, respondents propose a
series of novel standing theories. The first, inelegantly styled "ecosystem
nexus," proposes that any person who uses any part of a "contiguous
ecosystem" adversely affected by a funded activity has standing even if the
activity is located a great distance away. This approach, as the Court of
Appeals correctly observed, is inconsistent with our opinion in National
Wildlife Federation, which held that a plaintiff claiming injury from
environmental damage must use the area affected by the challenged activity and
not an area roughly "in the vicinity" of it. It makes no difference that the general-purpose section of the ESA states that
the Act was intended in part "to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon
which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved,"  To say that the Act protects ecosystems is not to say that
the Act creates (if it were possible) rights of action in persons who have not
been injured in fact, that is, persons who use portions of an ecosystem not
perceptibly affected by the unlawful action in question.

Respondents' other theories are called, alas, the "animal nexus" approach,
whereby anyone who has an interest in studying or seeing the endangered
animals anywhere on the globe has standing; and the "vocational nexus"
approach, under which anyone with a professional interest in such animals can
sue. Under these theories, anyone who goes to see Asian elephants in the Bronx
Zoo, and anyone who is a keeper of Asian elephants in the Bronx Zoo, has
standing to sue because the Director of AID did not consult with the Secretary
regarding the AID-funded project in Sri Lanka. This is beyond all reason.
Standing is not "an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable," but as we have said
requires, at the summary judgment stage, a factual showing of perceptible
harm. It is clear that the person who observes or works with a particular
animal threatened by a federal decision is facing perceptible harm, since the
very subject of his interest will no longer exist. It is even plausible--
though it goes to the outermost limit of plausibility--to think that a person
who observes or works with animals of a particular species in the very area of
the world where that species is threatened by a federal decision is facing
such harm, since some animals that might have been the subject of his interest
will no longer exist. It
goes beyond the limit, however, and into pure speculation and fantasy, to say
that anyone who observes or works with an endangered species, anywhere in the
world, is appreciably harmed by a single project affecting some portion of
that species with which he has no more specific connection.


The Court of Appeals found that respondents had standing for an additional
reason: because they had suffered a "procedural injury." The so-called
"citizen-suit" provision of the ESA provides, in pertinent part, that "any
person may commence a civil suit on his own behalf (A) to enjoin any person,
including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or
agency . . . who is alleged to be in violation of any provision of this
chapter." The court held that, because ยง 7(a)(2) requires
interagency consultation, the citizen-suit provision creates a "procedural
righ[t]" to consultation in all "persons"--so that anyone can file suit in
federal court to challenge the Secretary's (or presumably any other
official's) failure to follow the assertedly correct consultative procedure,
notwithstanding their inability to allege any discrete injury flowing from
that failure. To understand the remarkable nature of
this holding one must be clear about what it does not rest upon: This is not
a case where plaintiffs are seeking to enforce a procedural requirement the
disregard of which could impair a separate concrete interest of theirs (
e.g., the procedural requirement for a hearing prior to denial of their
license application, or the procedural requirement for an environmental impact
statement before a federal facility is constructed next door to them). Nor is
it simply a case where concrete injury has been suffered by many persons, as
in mass fraud or mass tort situations. Nor, finally, is it the unusual case in
which Congress has created a concrete private interest in the outcome of a
suit against a private party for the government's benefit, by providing a cash
bounty for the victorious plaintiff. Rather, the court held that the injury-
in-fact requirement had been satisfied by congressional conferral upon all
persons of an abstract, self-contained, noninstrumental "right" to have the
Executive observe the procedures required by law. We reject this view.


We have consistently held that a plaintiff raising only a generally available
grievance about government--claiming only harm to his and every citizen's
interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking
relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public
at large--does not state an Article III case or controversy. For example, [i]n Frothingham v. Mellon, (1923),
we dismissed for lack of Article III standing a taxpayer suit challenging the
propriety of certain federal expenditures. We said:

> The party who invokes the power [of judicial review] must be able to show not only that the statute is invalid but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as the result of its enforcement, and not merely that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally. . . . Here the parties plaintiff have no such case. . . . [T]heir complaint . . . is merely that officials of the executive department of the government are executing and will execute an act of Congress asserted to be unconstitutional; and this we are asked to prevent. To do so would be not to decide a judicial controversy, but to assume a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess."

More recent cases are to the same effect. In United States v. Richardson (1974) we dismissed for lack of
standing a taxpayer suit challenging the Government's failure to disclose the
expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency, in alleged violation of the
constitutional requirement that "a regular Statement and
Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be
published from time to time." We held that such a suit rested upon an
impermissible "generalized grievance," and was inconsistent with "the
framework of Article III" because "the impact on [plaintiff] is plainly
undifferentiated and common to all members of the public."  And in Schlesinger v.
Reservists Committee to Stop the War (1974), we dismissed for the same reasons a citizen-taxpayer suit contending that it was a violation of the Incompatibility Clause, Art. I, ยง 6, cl. 2, for Members of Congress to hold commissions in the military Reserves.
We said that the challenged action, "standing alone, would adversely affect
only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance.  And only two Terms ago, we
rejected the notion that Article III permits a citizen-suit to prevent a
condemned criminal's execution on the basis of "the public interest
protections of the Eighth Amendment;" once again, "[t]his allegation raise[d]
only the generalized interest of all citizens in constitutional governance . .
. and [was] an inadequate basis on which to grant . . . standing." Whitmore.

To be sure, our generalized-grievance cases have typically involved Government
violation of procedures assertedly ordained by the Constitution rather than
the Congress. But there is absolutely no basis for making the Article III
inquiry turn on the source of the asserted right. Whether the courts were to
act on their own, or at the invitation of Congress, in ignoring the concrete
injury requirement described in our cases, they would be discarding a
principle fundamental to the separate and distinct constitutional role of the
Third Branch--one of the essential elements that identifies those "Cases" and
"Controversies" that are the business of the courts rather than of the
political branches. "The province of the court," as Chief Justice Marshall
said in Marbury v. Madison,
"is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals." Vindicating the public
interest (including the public interest in government observance of the
Constitution and laws) is the function of Congress and the Chief Executive.
The question presented here is whether the public interest in proper
administration of the laws (specifically, in agencies' observance of a
particular, statutorily prescribed procedure) can be converted into an
individual right by a statute that denominates it as such, and that permits
all citizens (or, for that matter, a subclass of citizens who suffer no
distinctive concrete harm) to sue. If the concrete injury requirement has the
separation-of-powers significance we have always said, the answer must be
obvious: To permit Congress to convert the undifferentiated public interest in
executive officers' compliance with the law into an "individual right"
vindicable in the courts is to permit Congress to transfer from the President
to the courts the Chief Executive's most important constitutional duty, to
"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." Art. II, ยง 3. It would
enable the courts, with the permission of Congress, "to assume a position of
authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department," and to become "
'virtually continuing monitors of the wisdom and soundness of Executive
action.'

Nothing in this contradicts the principle that "[t]he . . . injury required by
Art. III may exist solely by virtue of 'statutes creating legal rights, the
invasion of which creates standing.'"  Both of the cases used by [quoted case] as an illustration of that principle involved Congress's elevating to the
status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, de facto injuries that were
previously inadequate in law (namely, injury to an individual's personal
interest in living in a racially integrated community, see Trafficante v.
Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (1972), and injury to a company's interest in marketing its
product free from competition, see Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co. (1968)). As we said in Sierra Club, "[Statutory] broadening [of] the categories of injury that may be
alleged in support of standing is a different matter from abandoning the
requirement that the party seeking review must himself have suffered an
injury." 

**Justice KENNEDY, with whom Justice SOUTER joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.**


While it may seem trivial to require that Mss. Kelly and Skilbred acquire
airline tickets to the project sites or announce a date certain upon which
they will return, this is not a case where it is
reasonable to assume that the affiants will be using the sites on a regular
basis, nor do the affiants claim to have visited the sites since the
projects commenced.
