# Fundamental Rights

We have now left the core idea of equal protection and our structure of classifications. It's time to introduce a new idea, that of "fundamental rights."

Like so much of constitutional law, fundamental rights is a muddle. I'm going to give you the blackletter Gilberts-style version first, and then I'll talk for a minute about how that melts down the moment you look at it funny.

Nonsense textbook version: fundamental rights is an alternate route to get into strict scrutiny. The way we've been talking about for the last month is just path #1: you get into strict scrutiny when there's a suspect classification in play. This is the second route: you also get into strict scrutiny when the government infringes a fundamental right.

## What's a fundamental right?

Usually we say the fundamental rights are the enumerated rights, all that stuff in the bill of rights about speech and religion and all that good stuff, plus a collection of unenumerated rights that the Court has, over time, found to be particularly important. 

We usually say the big five unenumerated fundamental rights are "**privacy**" (about which which much more in the coming days), **marriage** (which is closely connected to privacy, and the two together to sexual liberty, etc.), **access to judicial process**/the courts, **interstate travel**, and **voting**.^[Although, really, in light of the 15, 19, and 26th amendments, it's a little weird to call voting unenumerated; in light of the actual due process clause it's a little weird to call access to the courts unenumerated too, but there we go.] You could probably talk some parental stuff in there too if you really wanted, see discussion and citation of leading cases in the main opinion in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000).^[and see the first paragraph of Justice Scalia's dissent there for an important and very brief criticism of the whole business of enforcing unenumerated rights] 

A helpful way to think about this is as two separate clusters of rights, the "democratic citizen of the union" sorts of rights (voting, suing, moving from state to state) and the "personal and family" sorts of rights (marrying, intimate privacy, childrearing).

So say the government infringes the right to vote. LAW: "In order to register to vote, everyone has to first stand on one leg and sing the battle hymm of the republic to prove their patriotism." So that infringes the right to vote.^[and, if you actually read the lyrics, it also raises, to say the least, really serious Establishment Clause issues, since it's all "we're fighting for Jesus here folks, JESUS," oh, yeah, and the compelled speech doctrine of the other bit of the First Amendment too, but anyway...] In view of its infringement of the right to vote alone, the law gets strict scrutiny, and, in this case, obviously gets struck down if not actually laughed out of court.

### Discovering new fundamental rights

How does the court decide what's a fundamental right? Suppose you want to convince them to declare a new fundamental right? Well, there isn't a formula, but the key ideas are **tradition** and **importance**. 

First, tradition. If something has long been understood as a fundamental right associated with our constitutional tradition, then the Court might understand it as, in essence, a pre-constitutional right, as something that was presupposed by the constitution--in a bit, I'll talk about the 9th amendment, which is important in this vein.

Second, importance. If it looks like the right is sort of basic to living as a person in our society, to functioning as a social (and potentially also economic, but hold on for a bit and we'll talk about that too) actor, to enjoy the other rights, to participate as a democratic citizen, then the Court might understand it as a fundamental right too.

Sometimes the **existing consensus of the states** or more-or-less-relative consensus of the states is taken into account too, particularly in conjunction with development of the law over time: if 49 of 50 states have moved to protect some right, there's some chance that a lawyer will be able to convince the Court to impose it on the 50th as a fundamental right.

Unsurprisingly, however, it's very rare that the Court discovers a new fundamental right, and once again those separation of powers concerns and federalism concerns that we've been talking about all semester are paramount: to find a fundamental right is, in essence, to take an area of policy away from the states and Congress and hand it over to judges; the Court is naturally quite suspicious of that move.

The most important and full recent discussion of the method for deciding on fundamental rights is *Washington v. Glucksberg*, 521 U.S. 702 (1997) (upholding prohibition on assisted suicide, rejecting "right to die" as fundamental right), which we are reading.

## Warning on some terminological overlap

It's also worth noting that "fundamental rights" is another descriptor for the set of rights that the Court is willing to incorporate against the states via the 14th amendment's due process clause. (We'll talk about that in the incorporation/gun control module.) The relationship between those two invocations of the term isn't totally clear: we typically say (though maybe we shouldn't) that the enumerated rights are "fundamental" and hence get strict scrutiny, but not all the enumerated rights are "fundamental" for incorporation purposes; in particular, there are several jury-related rights in the bill of rights that have not been held by the Supreme Court to apply to the states.  But don't confuse these two uses of the terms "fundamental rights." Maybe they mean the same thing, maybe they don't.

## Breaking the traditional story down

Ok, there's the story you're going to have to be prepared to recite and apply on the bar exam, and, because we gotta test something, on my exams. Now let's talk about how much of a disaster it is. There are three big problems with this story:

1.  What's the doctrinal home?

2.  What's the textual home?  A.K.A. "Substantive due process": a blatant oxymoron; where'd the 9th amendment go?

3.  We hardly ever actually get strict scrutiny on fundamental rights

### Finding a doctrinal home? 

We sometimes talk about fundamental rights jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, and sometimes under the Due Process Clause (the latter under the name "substantive due process.") People tend to talk about them interchangeably, as if it's one big doctrine.

There's no good solution to this puzzle. The best that I can really say is that sometimes it really looks like an equal protection case. For example, in Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330 (1972), the Court struck down a Tennessee law requiring a year's residence in the state before being permitted to vote---an infringement of both the right to vote and the right to interstate travel. That has an equal protection smell, because the court is drawing a distinction between those who were resident in the state for a long time and those who were not.

Other cases have a more obvious substantive due process smell. For example, in Roe v. Wade, which we'll obviously be spending some time on, it's not like the law is best characterized as "here's a group of people who can have abortions, here's a group who can't." The law was "no abortions." (Well, sorta, because there was a life endangerment exception to the abortion law.)

So if you want a rule of thumb for very practical purposes (like what you write in the complaint), I'd say, probably please both, but if you don't want to plead both, call it "equal protection" if your client or their group was singled out for having the fundamental right infringed, and "due process" if everyone got the fundamental right infringed. But be skeptical of anyone who tells you that this reflects a real doctrinal distinction, and be prepared to apply strict scrutiny in either case, subject to the pointed noted below in #3.

### Is there a textual justification for this stuff?

We know where we get the enumerated rights from: they're enumerated. No unreasonable searches, no laws infringing free speech, all that good stuff. But what about the rest, the privacy and the interstate travel and all that stuff?

The conventional claim is that there exists a thing called "substantive due process."  Remember that "procedural due process," which we started with, is all about figuring out whether the government followed fair procedures, "substantive due process" is about protecting unenumerated fundamental rights. But they both come from the due process clause. 

Here's a quick capsule summary of some of the history of this stuff, which we'll be talking about more over the next few weeks. According to conventional wisdom, in the Bad Old Lochner Days (TM), the Supreme Court struck down most of the New Deal on a fundamental rights theory, talking about stuff like liberty of contract. The world almost ended, but then FDR managed to bully them into submission. Now "substantive due process" is a dirty word, and the court recognizes that it can't just make up rights to keep the legislature from doing public policy, except when it does. So basically, no economic fundamental rights, and now we're really skeptical of making up rights in general, but there are still these two big groups of fundamental unenumerated rights, the privacy cluster and the democratic citizenship cluster that I wrote about above.

Ok, fine, whatever. But the court's still making them up, you might think. Is there any textual basis for this? Well, those of you who have actually read the constitution (Go do it now, if you haven't already. It will only take a few minutes. Seriously, I mean it. You need to have a command over the text.) will probably think of that 9th amendment. After all, the 9th amendment is all over the unenumerated rights thing. *The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.* It's the actual bit of the constitution where the framers were, like, "dudes, these ain't the only rights." 

But nope, we don't get that. We get "substantive due process." The Court keeps insisting that unenumerated rights come from the due process clause rather than the 9th Amendment.

Now, here's what you might think about those three words, "substantive due process": they're blatantly stupid. One of the key binary oppositions through which we understand the law is "substance" vs. "process." The rules of civil procedure are process. The rules of tort are substance. The Erie doctrine (remember that?) says that in federal court you do federal procedure and state substance. "Substantive due process" is a blatant use of words for precisely the opposite of what they mean.

There are people who defend this stuff. But it's a hard fight. And the general consensus still is, I think, that "substantive due process" is a made-up idea.

Nonetheless, "substantive due process" is what the Court has given us. And typically, fundamental rights cases revolving around the unenumerated rights unhelpfully elaborate to say that the right in question is part of the "liberty" protected by the 5th and 14th amendments---which, you'll note, is totally meaningless, since the part anyone who can read objects to is the "due process" part, not the "liberty" part, i.e., to the proposition that, granting the fundamental right in question belongs in the liberty bucket, the due process clause means anything other than "notice and an opportunity to be heard for individual deprivations, the democratic process for collective deprivations," you know, like we learned in the beginning of the course. 

So we all have to pretend like we're talking about due process when we do fundamental rights jurisprudence, because those are the words the Supreme Court has told us we have to say, even if they don't make any sense. Legal formalism, thy name is substantive due process.

### Strict Scrutiny, wouldn't it be nice

Finally, #3. Remember how I said that you get strict scrutiny when the government infringes a fundamental right? Well, that's not true. Actually, strict scrutiny is kind of the default invocation, but lots of the time the Court applies lots of different tests. An easy example is in the First Amendment---as we'll see when we get to that module, depending on the kind of speech and the kind of restriction, you might get intermediate scrutiny, or strict scrutiny, or all kinds of other weird stuff. And that's so even though we say that the speech rights enumerated in the First Amendment are fundamental rights within the meaning of this area of jurisprudence. Same goes for abortion: Roe v. Wade articulated a complex test that was kind of derived from strict scrutiny (sorta), but then that got changed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to an "undue burden" test that has nothing visible to do with strict scrutiny.

So, again, we recite this formulation, and we test it (and I'm going to test it), "fundamental rights get strict scrutiny," but you really should only understand it as a rough rule of thumb, and be aware that within fundamental rights jurisprudence is a lot more complicated, and there are lots of little sub-doctrines which we'll explore. The unenumerated fundamental rights are more consistently strict scrutiny than the enumerated fundamental rights, but even there, there's a lot of wiggle. I want to recommend a very good article on this subject (and it's only a dozen pages long): Adam Winkler, Fundamentally Wrong about Fundamental Rights, 23 Constitutional Commentary 277 (2006) describes lots of places where we don't actually do strict scrutiny with fundamental rights. You really ought to read it.^[And by the way, about things you'll be tested on: you'll be expected to both know the "fundamental rights get strict scrutiny" formulation, and to know the numerous exceptions which we'll cover in class.]

Thinking about the First Amendment helps us see the absurdity of the notion of fundamental rights equals strict scrutiny. Let Justice Black be our guide: possibly his most famous quote comes from his concurrence in Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147 (1959):

> Certainly the First Amendment's language leaves no room for inference that abridgments of speech and press can be made just because they are slight. That Amendment provides, in simple words, that "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press." I read "no law . . . abridging" to mean no law abridging. The First Amendment, which is the supreme law of the land, has thus fixed its own value on freedom of speech and press by putting these freedoms wholly "beyond the reach" of federal power to abridge. No other provision of the Constitution purports to dilute the scope of these unequivocal commands of the First Amendment. Consequently, I do not believe that any federal agencies, including Congress and this Court, have power or authority to subordinate speech and press to what they think are "more important interests." The contrary notion is, in my judgment, court-made not Constitution-made.

Here's the thing. From a pure textual standpoint, isn't Justice Black actually exactly right? "No law" isn't exactly ambiguous! Even strict scrutiny seems like a weird idea in the context of things like the enumerated rights: the Constitution doesn't say "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech unless it's narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest." Nor, for that matter, does it say "Nor shall any state ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws unless it's narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest."^[Although you might be able to make an argument for equal protection, if equal protection means "treat people as equals" not "treat them the same," then maybe treating people as equals sometimes means treating them differently if there's a really good reason.  See Gowder, Equal Law in an Unequal World...]

When we think of that logic, which clearly poses serious problems for the application of any level of scrutiny to the enumerated rights (except for stuff like the 4th and 8th amendments which actually write ideas like "unreasonable" and "cruel and unusual" into the text), we might also want to worry that the same problem shows up for the unenumerated rights. If there really is a pre-constitutional right to something, then on what basis does Congress or a state legislature deprive an individual of it? What kind of right is it, ultimately, that can be infringed if the government has a really good reason, and why should the standard for really good reason even formally be the same in all these cases (albeit not necessarily actually)? Certainly the idea of due process, even if it includes enforcing unenumerated rights, doesn't also include some kind of strict scrutiny test. So there's a deeply unprincipled analytic strategy at the heart of this whole body of law. But it's what we got.

# Exercise: Gerrymandering

The State of Squarkeye has 100,000 people, evenly divided between [registered] Democrats and Republicans. In 2016, the territory is divided into five state legislative districts, with roughly 20,000 voters between them, and roughly equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans in each (each district is contested).

Propelled by the landslide national election of a slightly-less unpopular candidate than the other one, in the election of 2016, the Democrats win a majority in the state legislature. Immediately after their legislative session starts, they redraw the districts as follows: 

District 1: 20,000 Republicans, 0 Democrats

District 2: 7,500 Republicans, 12,500 Democrats

District 3: 7,500 Republicans, 12,500 Democrats

District 4: 7,500 Republicans, 12,500 Democrats

District 5: 7,500 Republicans, 12,500 Democrats

The state Republican party, plus an individual Republican voter in each district, file suit to challenge the redistricting under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the 14th Amendment.

Does it depend on the irregularity of the shape of the districts?

# Economic rights

Most of the questions about regulation of the economy in constitutional law show up in con law I, so this will actually be a very short section. 

## No economic fundamental rights

The first key idea is that **constitutional challenges to economic regulation only get rational basis scrutiny**. 

### Some history

The history, and we've noted this before, is that there was a period of jurisprudence known as the "Lochner era." The Lochner era did for economic rights kind of what the Griswold-Roe era did for personal and family rights, that is, it kind of took a variety of ideas, primarily the contracts clause and the various property rights protections, and generalized out from them to a general idea of economic liberty.^[Footnote: the Contracts Clause? What's that? Article 1, section 10: forbids states from "impairing the obligation of contracts." There's lots of debate about what it means; many have argued it just means prohibiting the states from passing bankruptcy laws on their own, leaving that power to Congress, others have argued that it prohibits the states repudiating their public contracts, particularly their public debts---that's closest to what the Court does with it today in those rare cases it comes up. Some libertarian legal scholars still read it as a general liberty of contract provision. We're not covering it in this class.]

This era was brought to an end by the New Deal. Basically, what happened is that the Court struck down all kinds of economic regulation, but political opposition was too strong. So Roosevelt started trying really harsh exercises of the political branches' power to keep the Court in line, primarily "court-packing," altering the number of justices on the court basically to ensure that he could win cases by appointing a bunch of allies, but he was also at various points considering "jurisdiction stripping," depriving the Court of jurisdiction over cases that could undermine the New Deal. Note that Article III section 2 permits jurisdiction-stripping in cases that don't arise within the Court's original jurisdiction ("In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make."). As for court-packing, the constitution doesn't specify the number of justices, and Congress had made that decision by statute from the start.

So then the court backed down. The standard story is that around the time the court-packing bill was introduced, Justice Owen Roberts thought to him self "oh dear, now we're really in trouble," and changed his vote, making it 5-4 against overturning a salient economic regulation, and from there, case after case start coming down upholding the New Deal. And that story, obviously, is a gross oversimplification, but it probably still captures the heart of the political environment. This is really a case study in what we've talked about periodically in this class, about how the Court doesn't really have ultimate power to undermine the democratic will, because its power over the political branches is only backed up by political support for it. If the political branches want, they can just ignore its rulings, or, as the New Dealers considered, gut it by statute, and they can get away with it as long as the people don't punish them at the polls for it. The rule now is "rational basis for economic regulation."

The tipping point is often assigned to the actual case in which Roberts switched, a case called West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937), which stated a rational basis standard for economic regulation in the course of upholding a minimum wage law for women (who, unsurprisingly given the time, were seen as in need of extra protection. Thanks patriarchy for getting rid of the Lochner era!).

So we're going to read Lochner, but mainly for historical reasons. We'll discuss the case, recognizing that not only is it not good law, but that it's kind of the opposite of good law: it's up there with Dred Scott and Plessey, although obviously not nearly as evil as those, in those cases that we use as judicial swear words --- tell a judge she or he is doing a Lochner thing, and those are fighting words.

### Should there be economic fundamental rights?

We're also reading it because I want us to take seriously the proposition that there should be economic fundamental rights. Let's consider two major arguments. 

The first is that the method for finding fundamental rights that we've examined can seem a lot like something that could be used to justify Lochner; when you're reading Lochner look out for places to find similarities to Griswold as well as to the two factors that we've isolated as leading to a judicial finding of a fundamental right. They won't be explicit in the text, but try to consider economic rights under the framework we've developed and ask whether they should be fundamental.

The second is the issue of corruption, or what economists call "rent-seeking." The case that most constitutional law professors point to in order to really highlight this worry is Wiliamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483 (1955). This was another leading post-Lochner case restating and making absolutely clear that economic regulations now get rational basis review. 

But the thing about the law that the Court upheld in this case is that it was blatantly corrupt. It prevented an optician from replacing the lenses in glasses without a new prescription from an optometrist. And we know why the law was enacted, or at least many people think we do: because some optometrists had cronies in the legislature, and they wanted to make a law to get more business. The district court tried to strike the law down under a rational basis standard; the court reversed. But should it have? Is it part of the proper role of the judiciary to guard against this kind of corrupt regulation? We'll talk about the concept of rent-seeking and discuss whether it ought to be constitutionally cognizable.

## One enumerated economic right (PROPERTY)

Of course, there's one place where the bill of rights does quite clearly establish an enumerated fundamental right, and that's to property. In addition to the fact that it shows up in the due process clause, it also shows up in the takings clause of the 5th amendment, which says that the government can't just grab private property for public use without paying compensation. There are two major questions about the takings clause.

### What's a public use?

The language in the Fifth Amendment about a "public use" is usually read as a limitation on the takings power: by saying "for public use," it seems to imply that the government can't just turn around and take property for private use, to rob Peter to pay Paul. 

The question came to a head a few years ago in Kelo v. New London, 545 U.S. 469 (2005), which considered a challenge to an "economic development taking," where the city condemned a bunch of land to devote to more economically productive private uses, essentially taking some people's houses to turn over to a private developer for things like hotels and restaurants and such. And the court held that this was perfectly ok: "public use" just means "public purpose," and that includes things like economic development.  

There's a lot of similarity between this debate and the Williamson v. Lee Optical debate, when you think about it: the question becomes, in both cases, will the Court intervene to protect the government from plundering or regulating one private party for the benefit of another? And the answer in both cases is "no," and with a broadly rational basis tint to it: as long as there's some colorable legitimate reason that could justify the law, like making sure experts approve all glasses, or increasing the local tax base of a town, the mere fact that these kinds of government acts are rife for the corrupt disregarding of private interests that don't happen to have a buddy in the legislature will not yield constitutional scrutiny. Both lines of cases, quite naturally, infuriate libertarians. 

The court in Kelo, however, did leave some door open for future challenges: it emphasized that what was at issue was a "comprehensive redevelopment plan," not a simple one-to-one transfer, and this might be constitutionally significant---it looks much more suspicious when instead of condemning a bunch of property for a big program, the city just says "the Ritz Carlton would really like to build a hotel on your land, so we're taking it."

### What's a taking?

We know that actually seizing property, like "you don't own this anymore," is a taking. But what about when the government just intrudes, or allows the public to intrude, on your property? What about when it starts demanding that you make all kinds of concessions or actual contributions to the public, like parks and parking lots, in order to get a building permit? What about when it regulates away all kinds of uses you'd like to make of your property?

There's a pretty good consensus that mandatory physical invasions are a taking, when, for example, the government insists on running power or water lines through your land or something, particularly when the invasion is permanent. (Which makes sense in property law terms, of course: that's just taking an easement; it's still an ordinary interest in land that the government seizes.) For example, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan, 458 U.S. 419 (1982) (taking found when city authorized cable company to install wiring on plaintiff's property)

Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 (1987) and Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994) are leading cases in the unconstitutional conditions area, and the short version is that the permit conditions have to be related and roughly proportional to the impact of the development: if your shopping mall will cause huge traffic and parking problems, the city can require you to provide a parking lot to mitigate the problem you're going to cause, without it being a taking, but it can't require you to provide a park across town, and it can't require you to provide the parking for every other building in the entire city.

There are two leading cases in the "regulatory takings" area, which together consider the question of whether government land use regulation can be sufficiently intrusive to be a taking. One of them, Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, we're reading. The other, Penn Central Transportation, we're not. I'll briefly describe Penn Central as a way into the black-letter stuff.

So Penn Central was a really crazy case. The short verison is that the owners of Grand Central Station in New York city proposed to put an incredibly ugly skyscraper on top of the station. Like, horrible, one of the worst examples of mid-20th century architecture. And the city, quite understandably, said no way no how.  So the claim was that this was a taking, essentially because by prohibiting the development, the city was causing massive economic loss (or at least a loss of a really lucrative opportunity) for the property owner, for the aesthetic benefit of the city.

The Court, in holding that there was no taking, announced something that people since have tended to characterize as a "test." But I'm not really sure it qualifies as such. If it's a test, it's an even looser muddle than the Matthews test. Supposedly, we balance (yes, it's another explicit balancing test):

- The economic losses inflicted on the owner

- The interference in the owner's investment-backed expectations for use of the land

- The "character of the government action"

The first two are relatively self-explanatory: if the government costs the private party a lot of money, that's more likely to be a taking; if the owner has sunk a lot of money into, for example, acquiring a bunch of land for development purposes which the government suddenly says "hey, no, you can't develop it," then it's more likely to be a taking. It's basically a reasonable reliance standard, if people sunk a bunch of money into land in reliance on one regulatory framework, it looks more like a taking if the rug is suddenly pulled out from under them. The character prong is sort of meaningless; the idea in Penn Central was that an actual "physical invasion" was more likely to be a character than just a mere regulation, but in later cases it became more broadly accepted that a physical invasion is pretty much always a taking, at least if it's a permanent invasion (like an easement) so there's not a lot left of this prong. (There are other views of the character prong, but they're all pretty messy, and there's little point in diving into this swamp.)

Actually, in Penn Central, Rehnquist's dissent probably gives a more coherent theory of takings than the majority: for him, the key idea of a taking is that it imposes a unique burden on an individual landholder, essentially makes the landholder pay for a general benefit, rather than imposing the costs of the benefit on the whole community through taxation. This view of takings naturally tracks some of the ideas we talked about in the early part of the course, the procedural due process concern with protecting against individualized action, the ideal of general law underlying the equal protection clause, etc.

At any rate, we'll be reading a different regulatory takings case, the other big leading case, Lucas. We'll obviously cover it in class, but in particular I'd like you to pay attention to the way in which constitutional protection depends on preexisting common law principles of property, and tort; to the court's theoretical argument for a special place in takings law for total deprivation; and to the court's argument about the difficulty of distinguishing between preventing a public harm and conferring a public benefit.

# Exercise: Career Counseling

The state of Illinois enacts the following law:

> (a) It is the conclusion of the Illinois Legislature that young Illinoisans are choosing, because of ignorance and economic over-optimism, to start their careers in low-paying rather than high-paying employment. Research suggests that a citizen's lifetime earning potential is strongly linked to his or her first full-time job after concluding his or her formal education. Illinoisans who choose to begin their careers in low-paying employment ultimately contribute less to the state's economy and are at greater risk of receiving public benefits later in their careers.

> (b) Accordingly, no resident of Illinois under the age of thirty (covered resident) may, after completing his or her formal education, take employment at a salary at or below the 25th percentile of the salaries for that resident's age, educational background, and locality (sub-25 position), unless she or he can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a licensed career counselor (LCC), that she or he cannot obtain a higher-paying position. If a LCC denies any such covered resident permission to take a sub-25 position, the covered resident may appeal the LCC's decision to an ordinary trial court, which may review the LCC's factual determinations with respect to the covered resident's inability to find higher-paying work. In the event of such an appeal, the covered resident may nonetheless take such a position until such time as the judicial process is fully completed.

> (c) The Illinois State Board of Career Counselor Licensing is hereby created in order to examine and certify the LCCs required to provide the services specified in section (b) of this statute. The Board shall establish, by regulation, licensure standards for LCCs as well as rules regarding the rates they may charge, continuing education requirements, and other suitable regulations. In no event shall the board permit a LCC to offer his or services at a rate less than $100 per hour. The board shall issue an initial license to all current members of the Illinois Association of Career Counselors, Inc.


- Given current doctrine, under what standard will this law be evaluated?

- What result on that standard?

Your group should write down an answer to each of those questions, as well as a brief explanation of your position.

(Yes, I know this would be an incredibly, incredibly stupid law. Suspend disbelief with me for a minute. )

# Exercise: Flipping Houses

The city of Chicago concludes that property speculators are unreasonably driving up the cost of residential property due to debt-financed house-flipping strategies. As a consequence, a local bubble is being formed and the cost of living is going through the roof. In addition, properties are becoming concentrated in the hands of exploitative landlords.

Accordingly, the city passes an ordinance: no person may sell residentially zoned real estate within three years of acquiring it, nor may any person convert an owner-occupied residence to a renter-occupied residence within that period, unless she or he establishes a personal residence more than 100 miles away. (We'll assume the city also finds a non-stupid way to apply this to corporate owners.)

A real estate developer who has purchased a number of residential properties, with the intention of flipping some of them and converting some of the others to rentals, sues, alleging a taking. What result?
