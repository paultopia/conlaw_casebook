**Category 1**: Congress has legislatively authorized the President to do it.

**Category 2**: Congress has neither authorized nor forbidden the Presidential action (it has not spoken).

**Category 3**: Congress has legislatively forbidden the Presidential action.

Take ten minutes or so and write down one concrete example for each of the following situations:

1. Something that would be impermissible for the President even under category 1.

2. Something that would be permissible for the President under category 1, but not permissible under category 2.
