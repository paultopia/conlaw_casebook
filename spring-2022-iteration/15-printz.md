# Printz v. Unied States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997)

**Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.**

The question presented in these cases is whether certain interim provisions of
the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, commanding state and local law enforcement officers to conduct background
checks on prospective handgun purchasers and to perform certain related tasks,
violate the Constitution.

The Gun Control Act of 1968(GCA) establishes a detailed federal scheme governing the distribution of firearms. It prohibits firearms dealers from transferring handguns to any person under 21, not resident in the dealer's State, or prohibited by state or local law from purchasing or possessing firearms. It also forbids possession of a firearm by, and transfer of a firearm to, convicted felons, fugitives from justice, unlawful users of controlled substances, persons adjudicated as mentally defective or committed to mental institutions, aliens unlawfully present in the United States, persons dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces, persons who have renounced their citizenship, and persons who have been subjected to certain restraining orders or been convicted of a misdemeanor offense involving domestic violence. 

In 1993, Congress amended the GCA by enacting the Brady Act. The Act requires
the Attorney General to establish a national instant background check system, and immediately puts in place certain
interim provisions until that system becomes operative. Under the interim
provisions, a firearms dealer who proposes to transfer a handgun must first:
(1) receive from the transferee a statement (the Brady Form) containing the name, address and date of birth of the proposed transferee along with a sworn statement that the transferee is not
among any of the classes of prohibited purchasers; (2) verify the
identity of the transferee by examining an identification document; and (3) provide the "chief law enforcement officer" (CLEO) of the transferee's residence with notice of the contents (and a copy) of the Brady Form. With some exceptions, the
dealer must then wait five business days before consummating the sale, unless
the CLEO earlier notifies the dealer that he has no reason to believe the
transfer would be illegal. 

The Brady Act creates two significant alternatives to the foregoing scheme. A
dealer may sell a handgun immediately if the purchaser possesses a state
handgun permit issued after a background check. In States that have
not rendered one of these alternatives applicable to all gun purchasers, CLEOs
are required to perform certain duties. When a CLEO receives the required
notice of a proposed transfer from the firearms dealer, the CLEO must "make a
reasonable effort to ascertain within 5 business days whether receipt or
possession would be in violation of the law, including research in whatever
State and local recordkeeping systems are available and in a national system
designated by the Attorney General.'' The Act does not require the
CLEO to take any particular action if he determines that a pending transaction
would be unlawful; he may notify the firearms dealer to that effect, but is
not required to do so. If, however, the CLEO notifies a gun dealer that a
prospective purchaser is ineligible to receive a handgun, he must, upon
request, provide the would-be purchaser with a written statement of the
reasons for that determination.  Moreover, if the CLEO does not
discover any basis for objecting to the sale, he must destroy any records in
his possession relating to the transfer, including his copy of the Brady Form. Under a separate provision of the GCA, any person who
"knowingly violates [the section of the GCA amended by the Brady Act] shall be
fined under this title, imprisoned for no more than 1 year, or both.''


Petitioners Jay Printz and Richard Mack, the CLEOs for Ravalli County,
Montana, and Graham County, Arizona, respectively, filed separate actions
challenging the constitutionality of the Brady Act's interim provisions. 

From the description set forth above, it is apparent that the Brady Act
purports to direct state law enforcement officers to participate, albeit only
temporarily, in the administration of a federally enacted regulatory scheme.
Regulated firearms dealers are required to forward Brady Forms not to a
federal officer or employee, but to the CLEOs, whose obligation to accept
those forms is implicit in the duty imposed upon them to make "reasonable
efforts'' within five days to determine whether the sales reflected in the
forms are lawful. While the CLEOs are subjected to no federal requirement that
they prevent the sales determined to be unlawful (it is perhaps assumed that
their state-law duties will require prevention or apprehension), they are
empowered to grant, in effect, waivers of the federally prescribed 5-day
waiting period for handgun purchases by notifying the gun dealers that they
have no reason to believe the transactions would be illegal.


The petitioners here object to being pressed into federal service, and contend
that congressional action compelling state officers to execute federal laws is
unconstitutional. Because there is no constitutional text speaking to this
precise question, the answer to the CLEOs' challenge must be sought in
historical understanding and practice, in the structure of the Constitution,
and in the jurisprudence of this Court. We treat those three sources, in that
order, in this and the next two sections of this opinion.


Petitioners contend that compelled enlistment of state executive officers for
the administration of federal programs is, until very recent years at least,
unprecedented. The Government contends, to the contrary, that "the earliest
Congresses enacted statutes that required the participation of state officials
in the implementation of federal laws,'' The
Government's contention demands our careful consideration, since early
congressional enactments "provid[e] "contemporaneous and weighty evidence' of
the Constitution's meaning.'' Indeed, such
"contemporaneous legislative exposition of the Constitution . . . , acquiesced
in for a long term of years, fixes the construction to be given its
provisions.''  Conversely if, as petitioners
contend, earlier Congresses avoided use of this highly attractive power, we
would have reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist.

The Government observes that statutes enacted by the first Congresses required
state courts to record applications for citizenship, to transmit abstracts of citizenship applications and
other naturalization records to the Secretary of State, and to register aliens seeking naturalization and
issue certificates of registry. It may well be, however, that these requirements applied only in
States that authorized their courts to conduct naturalization proceedings.  Other statutes of that era apparently or at least arguably
required state courts to perform functions unrelated to naturalization, such
as resolving controversies between a captain and the crew of his ship
concerning the seaworthiness of the vessel, hearing the claims of slave owners who had apprehended fugitive
slaves and issuing certificates authorizing the slave's forced removal to the
State from which he had fled, taking proof of the claims of Canadian refugees who had assisted the
United States during the Revolutionary War, and ordering the deportation of alien enemies in times of war.

These early laws establish, at most, that the Constitution was originally
understood to permit imposition of an obligation on state judges to enforce
federal prescriptions, insofar as those prescriptions related to matters
appropriate for the judicial power. That assumption was perhaps implicit in
one of the provisions of the Constitution, and was explicit in another. In
accord with the so-called Madisonian Compromise, Article III, ยง1, established
only a Supreme Court, and made the creation of lower federal courts optional
with the Congress-even though it was obvious that the Supreme Court alone
could not hear all federal cases throughout the United States.  And the Supremacy Clause, Art.
VI, cl. 2, announced that "the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the
supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound
thereby.'' It is understandable why courts should have been viewed
distinctively in this regard; unlike legislatures and executives, they applied
the law of other sovereigns all the time. The principle underlying so-called
"transitory'' causes of action was that laws which operated elsewhere created
obligations in justice that courts of the forum state would enforce.  The
Constitution itself, in the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, ยง1,
generally required such enforcement with respect to obligations arising in
other States. 

For these reasons, we do not think the early statutes imposing obligations on
state courts imply a power of Congress to impress the state executive into its
service. Indeed, it can be argued that the numerousness of these statutes,
contrasted with the utter lack of statutes imposing obligations on the States'
executive (notwithstanding the attractiveness of that course to Congress),
suggests an assumed absence of such power. The only early federal law the
Government has brought to our attention that imposed duties on state executive
officers is the Extradition Act of 1793, which required the "executive
authority'' of a State to cause the arrest and delivery of a fugitive from
justice upon the request of the executive authority of the State from which
the fugitive had fled. That
was in direct implementation, however, of the Extradition Clause of the
Constitution itself, see Art. IV, ยง2.3


Not only do the enactments of the early Congresses, as far as we are aware,
contain no evidence of an assumption that the Federal Government may command
the States' executive power in the absence of a particularized constitutional
authorization, they contain some indication of precisely the opposite
assumption. On September 23, 1789---the day before its proposal of the Bill of
Rights---the First Congress enacted a law
aimed at obtaining state assistance of the most rudimentary and necessary sort
for the enforcement of the new Government's laws: the holding of federal
prisoners in state jails at federal expense. Significantly, the law issued not
a command to the States' executive, but a recommendation to their
legislatures. Congress "recommended to the legislatures of the several States
to pass laws, making it expressly the duty of the keepers of their gaols, to
receive and safe keep therein all prisoners committed under the authority of
the United States,'' and offered to pay 50 cents per month for each prisoner.  Moreover, when Georgia refused to comply
with the request, Congress's only
reaction was a law authorizing the marshal in any State that failed to comply
with the Recommendation of September 23, 1789, to rent a temporary jail until
provision for a permanent one could be made.


[some stuff on the Federalist Papers] 



The constitutional practice we have examined above tends to negate the
existence of the congressional power asserted here, but is not conclusive. We
turn next to consideration of the structure of the Constitution, to see if we
can discern among its "essential postulate[s],'' a
principle that controls the present cases.

The Framers' experience under the Articles of Confederation had persuaded them
that using the States as the instruments of federal governance was both
ineffectual and provocative of federal-state conflict. See The Federalist No.
15. Preservation of the States as independent political entities being the
price of union, and " [t]he practicality of making laws, with coercive
sanctions, for the States as political bodies'' having been, in Madison's
words, "exploded on all hands,'' the Framers rejected the concept of a central
government that would act upon and through the States, and instead designed a
system in which the state and federal governments would exercise concurrent
authority over the people-who were, in Hamilton's words, "the only proper
objects of government.'' 

We have thus far discussed the effect that federal control of state officers
would have upon the first element of the "double security'' alluded to by
Madison: the division of power between State and Federal Governments. It would
also have an effect upon the second element: the separation and equilibration
of powers between the three branches of the Federal Government itself. The
Constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws
enacted by Congress; the President, it says, "shall take Care that the Laws be
faithfully executed,'' personally and through officers whom he
appoints (save for such inferior officers as Congress may authorize to be
appointed by the "Courts of Law'' or by "the Heads of Departments'' who are
themselves presidential appointees). The Brady Act effectively
transfers this responsibility to thousands of CLEOs in the 50 States, who are
left to implement the program without meaningful Presidential control (if
indeed meaningful Presidential control is possible without the power to
appoint and remove). The insistence of the Framers upon unity in the Federal
Executive-to insure both vigor and accountability-is well known.  That unity would be shattered, and the power of the President
would be subject to reduction, if Congress could act as effectively without
the President as with him, by simply requiring state officers to execute its
laws.


The dissent of course resorts to the last, best hope of those who defend
ultra vires congressional action, the Necessary and Proper Clause. It
reasons that the power to regulate the sale of handguns
under the Commerce Clause, coupled with the power to "make all Laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing
Powers,'' conclusively establishes the Brady Act's constitutional
validity, because the Tenth Amendment imposes no limitations on the exercise
of delegated powers but merely prohibits the exercise of powers " not
delegated to the United States.'' What destroys the dissent's Necessary and
Proper Clause argument, however, is not the Tenth Amendment but the Necessary
and Proper Clause itself. When a "La[w] . . . for carrying into Execution''
the Commerce Clause violates the principle of state sovereignty reflected in
the various constitutional provisions we mentioned earlier, supra, at __, it
is not a "La[w] . . . _proper_ for carrying into Execution the Commerce
Clause,'' and is thus, in the words of The Federalist, "merely [an] ac[t] of
usurpation'' which "deserve[s] to be treated as such.'' The Federalist No. 33.
