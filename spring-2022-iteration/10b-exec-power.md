# Separation of powers and executive power

The core separation of powers issues are between the President and Congress.  It's reasonable to think, from things like the Necessary and Proper Clause (which we will more closely examine in the next section when we get to McCulloch), that Congress was really intended to be the sort of main driving force of government when the Constitution got put together.  But over the centuries, the President has steadily grown in power, for at least two reasons:

1.  As the economy and technology have progressed, it's gotten a lot more complicated to regulate economic activity, so Congress has delegated a lot of authority to specialist administrative agencies within the Executive Branch.

2. As the U.S. has become a superpower and gotten involved in more stuff (and also as the threats against U.S. security have gotten more sophisticated), the military, intelligence services, law enforcement, and such, all under the President, have taken on a broader scope of activity to meet those needs. 

One way to think about the core questions in this part of the course is: "how should constitutional law respond to those changes in the world?"  Should the law/does the law quietly let the President grow in power, relative to Congress, or should it reign the executive branch in?

There are three settings where these questions tend to come up: 

1.  Congress delegates power to the President, authorizes the President to decide something.  There, the question typically is "is this something Congress may permissibly delegate to the President, or does it have to do it itself?"

2. President acts without explicit Congressional permission.  There, the question typically is, "is this something that the President can do on his own authority, or does it require a statute authorizing it?"

3. President acts against Congressional command, on the claim that the matter is within authority constitutionally delegated to  the President not to Congress. (In some cases, this is obviously true---e.g., the pardon power, but in many cases it's less clear, e.g., the division of authority for military action.)  There, obviously, the question is "is this an Article I or an Article II power?"

(Compare this to Justice Jackson's concurrence in *Youngstown Sheet and Tube v. Sawyer*.)

## Foundation: The Vesting Clause Question

There's an interesting linguistic difference between Article I and Article II.  Here's the relevant part of Article I: 

> All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States...

Here's the relevant part of Article II:

> The executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America...

Do you notice a difference?  Congress gets the legislative powers "herein granted."  The President just gets the executive power, full stop.  

Some people have read the absence of a "herein granted" in Article II to suggest that the President, unlike Congress, has *unenumerated* powers---that there was a background idea of the scope of executive power in the heads of the framers (maybe something to do with the kinds of powers traditionally exercised by the British Crown, only minus the bad tyrannical stuff), and the President gets to exercise all that stuff.  People who think that way tend to think that the specific grants of power in Article II are merely by example, or stuff that the Framers wanted to be absolutely sure the President got, not an exclusive list. 

There's also the "take care clause," providing that the president shall "take care that the laws are faithfully executed."  This too is textually ambiguous: is it a restraint, just commanding that the president shall do his/her job and enforce the laws Congress passes?  Or is it a broader power to take necessary action to hold the system together (like, for example, by seizing steel mills during a war...)?

The textual argument on the other side is that the rest of Article II grants specific powers to the president. Typically when general language is followed by specific language, we interpret specific language as constraining the general; more concretely, if the president has all the executive power, why would we need to specifically say that he has the pardon power, the commander in chief role, the power to make appointments, etc.?

Other people give more weight to the Necessary and Proper Clause, which gives Congress, not the President, the power to carry into effect the powers of the whole federal government, including the executive branch: 

> To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.

While scholars (bizarrely, in my opinion) disagree about whether the President is an "officer" of the United States, it's manifestly the case that executive agencies and personnel are such departments and officers, and so given that the President acts through those agencies, it seems pretty fairly implied by that text that Congress has the power to decide how a bunch of executive tasks get carried out. Thus, if you give a lot of importance to the stuff after the comma in the N&P clause, you'll probably be inclined to think that even if the President does have a bunch of unenumerated powers, Congress gets to decide how they get carried out, gets to make rules about their exercise, etc.

## Major Areas of Controversy

As we get started, I'd like to give you a quick overview of the major substantive areas where controversies often arise about the balance of power between Article I and Article II.

- Foreign relations.  Who has the power to recognize foreign countries?^[Here, "recognize" means "grant formal diplomatic status to."  This *really matters a lot.*  For example, China might well declare war if the U.S. granted formal diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. Israel has a big stake in what the U.S. says about Palestine. etc. etc.]  How much stuff can the president agree to do, and actually commit the U.S. to doing, in an "executive agreement" rather than a treaty ratified by the Senate?  (And how much stuff can the President and Senate together get done by treaty without going through the full lawmaking process and involving the House?)

- Military action. Congress has the power to declare war, but the President is the Commander in Chief of the army.  Can the President use troops, e.g., to invade somewhere else, without Congressional consent? 

- How much policy change can the President achieve by an "executive order" issuing commands to the agencies within the executive branch?  More generally, how much power does the President have to order around officials within the executive branch?  Do we have what's called a "unitary executive," where, e.g., the entire state department, EPA, Patent and Trademark Office, etc. etc. are merely extensions of the President's will subject to very granular orders at all times ("you shall approve this patent," "you shall grant this procurement contract to X Corp., not Y Corp."), or does the bureaucracy have independent decision-making power? 

- Related to the last one, can the President fire executive branch officials at will?  Can Congress pass laws insulating executive branch officials from firing (e.g., saying that some official can only be fired for cause)? 

- How much legislative power may Congress delegate to the President? Under what circumstances may Congress authorize agencies under the supervision of the White House to enact "regulations" that have the force of law?  How much discretion may Congress give such agencies?  May Congress give the President other powers over the legislative process by law, like the infamous "line-item veto" they tried in the 90's, where the President could veto individual parts of budget bills?^[The Supreme Court said "no" to that one. Clinton v. New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998).]

A lot of these questions also come up in administrative law, which you really should take.

## A Bit of History

To understand the debates over executive power and separation of powers, it helps to have a little history under your belt. 

There have been two great controversies in the territory of the first half of constitutional law. The first is the scope of Congress's power over the economy (our next module). The second is the President's power to use the officials of the executive branch to carry out his or her preferred policies, or, on a more modest version of the argument, to act in times of national emergency. This is often called "inherent power," because it's claimed that it's inherent to the executive function, not a result of a specific grant like the veto power or the pardon power or the commander in chief power or the like. For example, when Congress couldn't agree to raise the government debt ceiling in 2011 and there was a real risk of default, law professors [Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/opinion/22posner.html?_r=0) claimed that President Obama had the power to raise the debt ceiling by personal fiat to prevent economic crisis.^[Note: I think this is an incredibly stupid idea. But respectable people---or, at least, what amounts to the same idea, professors at fancy law schools---made it, and that fact alone is interesting.]

Simplifying a little, the key question is whether the President is a mere functionary--whose job it is to simply carry out the instructions of Congress, run the day-to-day business of administration in accordance with those instructions, plus to execute a very small handful of independent powers, like the pardon power and the veto power. Or is the president a mighty source of independent power, able to carry out a policy agenda independent of Congress?  Or, most likely, something in between?

A lot of what we'll see in this section is originalist argument on the question. But what we'll see is that the views of the framers---and for that reason, we might also imagine the framing generation---are quite unclear, and even move back and forth. There's a point where Madison and Hamilton swap positions on executive power, for example.

As for more straightforwardly normative and structural arguments, here there are also good arguments on both sides. On the side of more presidential power, people point out first that the president is the only person actually elected by the entire country, and also that the president has the capacity for swift action in times of national emergency, particularly when matters of war and peace are involved. Against, the fear is the centralized power can lead to tyrannical government with too much power---especially since the president's control over the military establishment and its capacity and need for secret action mean that often things the president does are imperfectly at best subject to democratic checks, as we've seen for example with the surveillance scandals of the last few years. Requiring statutory authorization for everything the president does, and constraining executive discretion, can be seen as a bulwark against this kind of power, and against developing the kind of executive prerogative that the framers sometimes say they saw in the British crown before the revolution.

That word, *prerogative*, is really important.  One position that was kicked around for a few centuries in England was that the King had a reservoir of power above and beyond Parliament, that could be used to, for example, impose forced loans (that is, taxes) and imprison people who didn't pay. This was the occasion for an immense amount of conflict between Crown and Parliament, and even contributed to a brief revolution in the 17th century; actually, by the time of *our* revolution the royal prerogative was mostly gone, but people were still scared of it---and are still scared of it today.^[In the last footnote, I threw some mud at Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule, who have ludicrously excessive views of the breadth of executive power. For the polar opposite problem, you might read the work of Phillip Hamburger, yet another professor at a fancy school.  He has argued, essentially, that ordinary administrative law notice and comment rulemaking is equivalent to the royal prerogative to imprison people without trial exercised by the Stuart kings. This view is also stupid, and it says something about the decline of the Constitutional Law professioriat that some of our most famous constitutional law scholars take such ludicrously unreasonable positions on both sides of the executive power debate.] The power to, for example, imprison U.S. citizens without trial on national security grounds, claimed in the war on terror, smells a lot like prerogative.

Almost immediately after the founding, the question arose whether or not the President has the power to fire executive officials.^[For background: there are three kinds of executive officials: those who are appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate (who are typically high officials like cabinet members); subordinate officials who are usually hired within the bureaucracy or appointed by cabinet members (either as an administrative responsibility, or because Congress has vested the appointment power in them pursuant to its power noted in Article II sec. II.), and officials for whom Congress has vested the appointment power outside the executive branch.] The First Congress was considering the creation of a Department of Foreign Affairs, and had a month-long debate about where the power to remove the head of that department should be, and whether the Constitution vested that power in the president. The result, known as the "decision of 1789," is often cited for the proposition that the First Congress, and particularly Madison as a leader of that debate, had endorsed the theory that the President has the power to fire executive officials. Yet it was not all clear what the founders believed. Hamilton, for example, had not that long beforehand written Federalist 77, which claimed that the Senate's power to consent to appointments came with the Senate's power to consent to firings, and that this was an important feature of the Constitutional order, promoting stability of government. 

A few years later, Hamilton and Madison switched sides on the abstract issue of how powerful the President should be, in a sense: George Washington had issued a proclamation of neutrality in a war that had been recently started with France; in a famous serial debate known as the letters of Pacificus (Hamilton) and Helvidus (Madison), Hamilton argued that the President had inherent power to issue this declaration. Madison, by contrast, argued that he did not.  So those two most important of our Founding Fathers(tm) clearly disagreed on basic questions of executive power, not only with one another but also with themselves... 

Fast-forward to the second great removal debate. After the death of Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, a southern Democrat (read: bad guy), became president and started to roll back Reconstruction.^[Quick history reminder: Reconstruction was the set of programs that the Radical Republicans in Congress enacted in order to help out the freed slaves and bring the South to heel.] The Radical Republicans who dominated Congress, aiming to forestall Johnson's betrayal of Lincoln's legacy, enacted the Tenure in Office Act, which forbade the firing of officials (that is, Lincoln's appointees) without the Senate's approval. It passed over Johnson's veto, and Johnson promptly violated it, firing the reconstructionist Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton. The House of Representatives impeached Johnson by an overwhelming majority, and he was spared removal in the Senate by a single vote. The act was repealed a couple of presidents later. The debate about the President's power to remove continues to this day.

The potential for abusing the power to sack officials has also been seen more recently than Andrew Johnson's use of it to undermine reconstruction. The infamous "Saturday Night Massacre" is the most important example. In fall 1973, Richard Nixon was under investigation for his many crimes, and Archibald Cox, the special prosecutor in charge of the investigation, was getting on Nixon's nerves.^[Incidently, my [crim law professor back in the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vorenberg) was Cox's deputy.] So Nixon ordered the attorney general to fire Cox. The attorney general refused, and resigned. Then Nixon ordered the deputy attorney general to fire Cox. He too refused and resigned. Finally, the solicitor general, Robert Bork, took Nixon's orders and fired Cox. A district court judge ultimately ruled that the firing was illegal, on the basis of DoJ regulations.  Nixon eventually, of course, got hounded out of office. (See above, re: many crimes.)

Modern controversies over executive power continue. For decades, presidents and Congress have disagreed over the constitutionality of the War Powers Act, which attempts to limit the amount of time the President can have troops deployed abroad without Congressional authorization.  

More recently, the Obama Administration was embroiled in political controversy as well as litigation over DACA, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program--that's where Obama declined to enforce immigration laws against people who came to the country in violation of those laws as children---the famous dreamers. Challengers alleged, among other things, (a) that Congress, not the President, has the authority to determine who gets to stay in the country, and (b) that the President has a duty in Article II under the "take care" clause to actually enforce the laws. The basic Constitutional argument on behalf of Obama was that the executive always has prosecutorial discretion on what laws to enforce---just like the local cop has the discretion not to write you a ticket for speeding, to let you off with a warning, and just like the local District Attorney has the discretion to decide not to prosecute victimless drug crimes, the President has the discretion to say that the nation's immigration enforcement resources are better spent on higher-priority matters, and to systematically refuse to prosecute certain categories of immigrants. The Supreme Court [heard a case about this program](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-texas/) in 2016, but got stuck on a 4-4 tie.

More recently, still, of course, immense controversies embroiled Trump's use of executive power, for example by attempting to declare a state of emergency (under relevant legislation) to [divert federal funds](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/us/politics/national-emergency-trump.html) for work on his border wall.^[In the other direction, it may be of interest to you that many presidents have claimed a power of "impoundment" to decline to spend funds appropriated by Congress. Jefferson kicked it off by declining to spend some money appropriated for the navy. See Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975) for Congress's power to restrict this alleged power of impoundment.]

## What's the point?

The framers were, yet again, concerned with preventing what they saw as tyranny---as the government getting too big for its britches and bossing people around in unacceptable ways.^[By the way, what exactly *is* tyranny? Well, for the framers, it was, roughly speaking, some combination of infringements on individual rights and narrow interests ("factions") bossing everyone else around. Though matters get much more complicated quickly when we try to peel this onion.]  

Both federalism (divided sovereignty between state and federal levels) and separation of powers (divided federal powers between branches) are directed at preventing tyranny by forcing anyone who actually wants to do anything to get other people's consent, and, in particular, other people's consent where those other people are elected by different constituencies and have different institutional incentives. For example, the Senate was originally elected by state legislatures, as opposed to the House, which has always been elected by the people; the idea was (roughly) that elites in the Senate would have a veto over populist stuff initiated in the House, and populists in the House would have a veto over elitist stuff initiated in the Senate. (They got a lot of these ideas from Rome.)

Here's Federalist 51 on the subject of separation of powers in particular:

> But the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights. These inventions of prudence cannot be less requisite in the distribution of the supreme powers of the State.

## Foreign affairs are messy

Foreign affairs rules are difficult.  If I had to distill some rules out of it for purposes of exams and such, it would probably look like this: 

1.  Justice Jackson's typology. Do it.

2. Preexisting practice matters a lot.  Many of these cases revolve around discussions of what presidents going back to George Washington thought they could do. 

3. When Presidents act with plausible Congressional authorization, the courts will rarely get in the way (absent violation of federalism or individual rights principles).

4. The President has broad power to make "executive agreements" with foreign countries, with effects similar to treaties, and they've never been struck down; on the other hand, the President has never tried to make an "executive agreement" that conflicts with a statute, and it seems much less likely that such a thing would be upheld.

5. When there is a conflict between a treaty and a federal statute, they're treated as of equivalent precedence, i.e., the last one wins.  This is why Congress can abrogate a treaty at will, and why, presumably, it can also control the alleged "executive agreement" power.

# Administrative law


Much of the material about executive power starts to shade into administrative law.  As I keep saying, you really need to take that course; this material will help you see why.  I can't really teach you any significant part of adlaw at the same time as constitutional law, but I can at least give you a basic introduction to the key terms and concepts so that you can understand this week's reading. 

So here's something you might not know. Huge amounts of law, especially but not exclusively in the domain of economic regulation, is written by executive branch agencies under the control of the President, pursuant to a delegation of authority from Congress.

Just to give you an idea of the scope of the regulatory state, here are some particularly huge examples: 

- Title 26 of the Code of Federal regulations is filled with Treasury Department regulations interpreting and filling out the Internal Revenue Code. That is, these are sources of law that directly apply to you and dictate how you file your taxes, how the various provisions in the tax code will be read to pick your pocket, etc. 

- The DEA gets to ban drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. You can see the list of the DEA actions to add to the list here: https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/

- Of course, commercial life is comprehensively regulated. Financial regulation, for example, shows up in regulations by the SEC, FDIC, etc. etc. etc. 

- Title 40 of the CFR is run by the EPA, which regulates all kinds of activities that affect the environment. 

I could go on for a very long time.

Here's something else you might not know. Huge amounts of adjudication of these rules of law is carried out in the first instance by people called "Administrative Law Judges," who rule on cases within executive agencies. Here are some more examples: 

- If you file a claim for Social Security benefits, and it's denied, your first appeal is to an ALJ within the SSA. 

- Many labor law claims, including union disputes, whistleblower protections, etc. can be decided by ALJs.

- The Securities and Exchange Commision initiates enforcement actions against people alleged to have violated securities laws through its ALJs. 

There are serious questions about the constitutionality of the ALJ system---see [this blog post for more](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/28/are-the-secs-administrative-law-judges-unconstitutional/) and also [this](http://blogs.orrick.com/securities-litigation/2016/03/30/breaking-news-supreme-court-declines-to-address-the-constitutionality-of-securities-and-exchange-administrative-forum/).  There are particular worries when these agencies adjudicate cases that look quasi-criminal, such as SEC enforcement actions that can involve substantial monetary penalties against individuals. 

There are also serious questions about the constitutionality of the regulatory system. In particular, a doctrine known as *Chevron* deference says that courts have to defer to agency interpretations of the statutes they enforce---but this has been quite widely questioned as an inappropriate surrender of the Judicial Branch's duty to, as Chief Justice Marshall put it, "say what the law is."  

Indeed, the whole system of issuing regulations has been questioned as a violation of the oft-referenced but rarely used nondelegation doctrine. The intuition here, in simple forms, is this: the Framers required that laws be subject to the approval of both Houses of Congress and the President or a veto override for a reason, namely, in order to present abuse of power that might come with the unchecked power to make rules. But allowing administrative agencies to make rules without that kind of process leads to too much concentration of power---especially when they also get to adjudicate those same rules.^[The Administrative Procedures Act does impose many constraints on the rulemaking and adjudicative process of agencies, however. You'll learn about this when you take administrative law.]

Note that Justice Gorsuch in particular (but to a lesser degree others too) is known to be opposed to *Chevron* deference. This may change the direction the Court takes with respect to these questions in the long run.
