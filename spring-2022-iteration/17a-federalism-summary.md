# Summary of Federalism Doctrine


As we've discussed, the federal government has limited power. In the context of federalism, the key implication is that that Congress can only pass laws that the Constitution specifically says it can pass. Everything else is left for the states. 

Why did the framers do this?  Well, one reason is as a necessary compromise: the people at the time of the founding felt some loyalty to their states, and states demanded it. An additional complication, of course, was the effect of slavery, and the desire of states to retain their autonomy either permitting or forbidding it. 

But there were perhaps less brutally pragmatic reasons too. In a diverse country, people of different states have different interests---agricultural states might have different interests from industrial states, for example, and might need different laws in order to accommodate them.^[Here's a classic example. States have different laws about damage caused by wandering (i.e. trespassing) livestock. In rancher-heavy states, the law tends to be that you have to fence off your land or the livestock owner isn't liable ("fence-out" states). In farmer-heavy states, the law tends to be that owners of livestock have to keep the livestock penned in or they're liable for damage they do to other people's land ("fence-in" states).]  They also just have different values---conservative states might want to have fewer public benefits than liberal states, for example. There's also a democratic benefit in having governments representing smaller population groups making more decisions---it means individuals have more influence on who gets elected, which also means they have more of an incentive to actually learn something about the issues and vote sensibly. 

The federal system also fits into the general idea of the framers trying to protect against government tyranny. If the federal government requires help from the states to implement its policies, then state governments can resist overreaching federal policies. For example, even though marijuana is still a controlled substance under federal law, those states that have legalized it under state law can more-or-less make it possible for their citizens to have it---not because they have the power to override federal law (they don't), but because the federal government on its own doesn't have the resources to enforce its drug prohibitions---it needs the help of state police officers and courts to effectuate marijuana prohibition, and those states that have made it legal under state law are obviously going to be inclined to withhold that assistance.  Federal law enforcement often depends on voluntary cooperation from state and local police. (See also the debate about immigration "sanctuary cities" and even "sanctuary states.")

Of course, the anti-oppression assistance can go the other way too, especially after the civil war, when the three Reconstruction amendments gave Congress the power to enforce racial equality against the states. We'll talk about this some weeks down the road.

There are also a number of situations where we might think that state power is a bad idea. For example, suppose states could impose import duties against one another? Or suppose they could craft their own foreign policies? The framers realized that a number of things are best done on the national level, and allocated those powers to the federal government.

Now you're probably thinking "wait a minute, the Constitution is only a few pages long, and the federal government does a huge amount of stuff. What gives, Gowder?  Where are those limited powers of yours?" Well, what gives is that there are two gigantic holes that Congress has been driving the legislative truck through for a long time: the Necessary and Proper Clause and the Commerce Clause.  

The Commerce Clause is the subject of a subsequent handout.  I'll cover the Necessary and Proper Clause right now.

## Necessary and Proper

Congress can enact legislation that is "necessary" and "proper" to carry out its enumerated powers. 

### What’s Necessary?

Justice Marshall, in McCulloch, establishes the principle that “necessary” doesn’t mean “essential,” instead, it roughly means “useful.”

Moreover, separation of powers considerations suggest that Congress, not the Court, should be the judge of what is useful to carry out its enumerated powers. In Marshall’s words: 

> If a certain means to carry into effect of any of the powers expressly given by the Constitution to the Government of the Union be an appropriate measure, not prohibited by the Constitution, the degree of its necessity is a question of legislative discretion, not of judicial cognizance.

Note how this presupposes that Congress is pursuing one of its enumerated powers. Thus, we might read the quoted statement from Marshall above as a two-part test:

1.  Is Congress carrying out one of its enumerated powers?

2.  If so, is the means Congress has chosen rationally related to that end (and not otherwise prohibited, but that goes without saying)?

The second part of the test is a constitutional idea that is often known as "rational basis"---we'll see *lots and lots and lots* of this idea in constitutional law. 

Justice Breyer’s opinion in Comstock gives a somewhat more complicated formulation that seems more like a balancing test:

1.  Rational relationship to implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power.

2.  Modest addition to existing statutes (with a longstanding history).

3.  Extension/natural consequence of an existing (constitutional) system and reasonably adapted to the powers that system exercises.

4.  Properly accounts for state interests.

5.  Links between act and Article I enumerated power not so attenuated that it’s a general police power.

### What about Proper?

The clause says necessary and proper. In principle, it’s possible for there to be some statute that is necessary (in the sense of “useful”) to some enumerated power, but not “proper,” and hence unconstitutional.

Justice Marshall seemed to treat “proper” as roughly equivalent to “not banned by some other provision of the constitution.” In his words:

> If the end be legitimate, and within the scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitutionally be employed to carry it into effect. 

Lately, we’ve seen an attempt to make “proper” do some independent work, most importantly in Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion in NFIB v. Sebelius. 

That opinion suggested that the individual mandate wasn’t a “proper” way of carrying out Congress’s power over commerce because it’s not “narrow in scope,” but instead would be “a substantial expansion of federal authority” into an area traditionally left to the states. The key idea is that a law is not proper when it “undermine[s] the structure of government established by the Constitution,” by trampling too far on state policy territory. We’ll have to see if this goes anywhere in future cases.

# Commerce Clause

The very short version: Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce became, in the latter 2/3 of the 20th century, the foundation for a truly staggering amount of federal regulation. Far more of our economic life is under the authority of the federal government than the Framers (with the possible exception of Alexander Hamilton) could have ever imagined.  Moreover, the federal government has use the commerce clause to reach a substantial amount of what some people might call non-economic activity as well as purely intra-state activity too.

In recent decades there have been substantial challenges to this broad power, some of which have been successful. Accordingly, it's all the more important to learn the history, because it might be that the Supreme Court will further roll back the commerce power. If it does so, lawyers involved in Commerce Clause litigation will need to understand the variety of possible positions on the extent of the power that have been taken in the past, so that they may advocate for their clients in selecting among them.

## Historical Periods

There are several distinct periods of commerce clause doctrine: 

1. The end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century featured a Court that took a fairly restrictive view of the commerce power. 

2. The mid-20th century Court, from roughly *Wickard v. Filburn* to *United States v. Lopez*, took a very expansive view of the commerce power; essentially anything Congress wanted to do was acceptable. The Court struck down no laws as exceeding Congress's commerce power between 1937 and 1994.

3. The late 20th century and contemporary court, from *Lopez* onward, has been rolling back the earlier commerce clause expansion. In consequence, the doctrine is currently unsettled: it's unclear where the limits lie, or to what extent we might anticipate a return to some of the ideas from the earlier period. 

## Key Questions

Congress has power to regulate (1) "commerce" (2) "among the several states." Observe that there are at least two textual elements necessary in order to be a valid exercise of the commerce clause power.^[We'll see that Chief Justice Roberts's opinion in *NFIB v. Sebelius* suggests a third element as well: the Congressional enactment must be a *regulation*, where that means a rule governing existing commercial activity as opposed to commanding new commercial activity.]

The cases focus on four key questions: 

1. What's commerce?

2. What's "among the several states"?

3. How much deference do we give Congress about what substantially affects interstate commerce?

4. To what extent can Congress use the commerce power to get at noneconomic or intrastate policy ends?

### What's Commerce?

From *Gibbons v. Ogden*, we learn that commerce isn't just limited to buying and selling of goods---at the very least, commercial interstate transportation (aka: the buying and selling of services) is covered. 

Once you have transportation as well as buying and selling, the rest follows pretty easily: "commerce" means interstate economic activity in general, and also sweeps in some noneconomic activity using facilities (like the roads) that are also used in interstate commerce. Often we summarize this last idea by saying that Congress may regulate the **channels** and **instrumentalities** of interstate commerce. This means things like transportation networks are subject to Congressional regulation too.

### What's interstate?

The Court in *E.C. Knight* interpreted an antitrust law as not applying to manufacturing in order to make it constitutional.^[This is an important general principle of constitutional adjudication: if the Court can find a limiting interpretation of a statute that makes it constitutional, they'll choose it.] The theory was that manufacturing is not interstate commerce. This is no longer good law, but it's a good case to highlight the question: how is a regulation of manufacturing a regulation of interstate commerce? Possible arguments include: 

1. Manufacturing happens with materials that have travelled in interstate commerce. 

2. Manufacturing affects interstate commerce because if you make something, you don't have to buy it, and it affects the interstate market (this was a key idea in *Wickard v. Filburn*, albeit about agriculture rather than manufacturing).

3. Manufacturing affects interstate commerce because manufacturers compete with one another across state lines, so what a manufacturer in one state can get away with changes what a manufacturer in another state can get away with (this was a key idea in *United States v. Darby*).

### Interlude: The Substantial Effects Test 

Ultimately, the first and second issues were resolved in the cases we'll read soon with the **substantial effects test**. *NLRB v. Jones* and *United States v. Darby* capture the development of this doctrine, with *Wickard v. Filburn* being its high point. If some activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, Congress can regulate it. **This is extremely important.**

The substantial effects test is really a necessary and proper kind of idea: much like Congress's power over currency and such gives it the power to make a national bank in order to achieve its currency (etc.) policy, Congress's power over commerce gives it power over some intrastate/non-commercial activity in order to effectuate its commerce policy. Therefore, for example, Congress can reach activities that aren't clearly commerce or aren't clearly interstate if its regulation of interstate trade would be less effective without also regulating that activity.

Another important element of the substantial effects test is that the effects can be **aggregate**. In *Wickard* and in *Heart of Atlanta*, it wasn't relevant that one farmer's wheat production or one hotel owner's racial discrimination wouldn't affect the overall market for wheat or hotels; because discrimination in public accommodations in general affected the ability of African-Americans to participate in interstate commerce, and because wheat-growing in general affected the stability of the system of price controls Congress was imposing, Congress could regulate individual activity in those areas.

The substantial effects test was dominant through most of the 20th century, and is still good law today, although, as we'll see, in cases like *Lopez* and *Morrison*, the Court has reined it in somewhat. 

### How Much Deference?

Now that we have a substantial effects test, we have to answer the question: who gets to decide what counts as a substantial effect? 

The mid-20th-century cases show a substantial amount of deference, that resembles something like a **rational basis test**, i.e., if Congress could have rationally thought that some activity had a substantial effect on interstate commerce, it can regulate it. *Lopez* and *Morrison* are somewhat less deferential.^[In particular, there's now some talk about whether Congress must have evidence and/or formal Congressional findings to support the notion that some activity substantially effects interstate commerce. It's not clear yet how far the Court will go in this direction.]

### Indirect Regulation?

Here's a not-really-a-hypo hypo: assuming that wages and hours aren't themselves regulable under the commerce clause (i.e., because employment is intrastate), can Congress regulate them by prohibiting the transport of goods in interstate commerce where those goods have been made under working conditions that violate the Congressional policy? 

The early 20th century Court struggled to answer this question. Sometimes we saw the argument that Congress either has to have a commercial *motive*, as oppoed to something like a motive to carry out morals regulation (e.g., as the dissent argued in *Champion v. Ames*). Sometimes we saw the argument that the law had to have commercial or economic *effects* (*Hammer*). 

However, the mid-20th-century cases abandoned these ideas. *Heart of Atlanta* is a good example, where it's clear that the point and effect of the regulation weren't to create more interstate travel but to promote racial equality. 

Today, it's generally accepted that Congress may regulate noneconomic activity by prohibiting the use of interstate commerce to carry it out. For example, the Mann Act (enacted 1910) forbade the transport of women across state lines for immoral purposes.^[I think it was later amended to be slightly less blatantly sexist, and is now mostly used as an anti-prostitution/anti underage sex transport provision... but check with a criminal person to make sure that's right]. It's clearly within the commerce power. Because it's a regulation of the channels of interstate commerce, it doesn't matter that Congress was actually trying to outlaw kinds of sex it disapproves of. (Cf. *Hoke v. United States*, 227 U.S. 308 (1913).)

## The Demand for a Limiting Principle

In *Hammer* we also see an extremely important strategy of constitutional argument that comes up a lot in the commerce clause and necessary and proper cases: the demand for a limiting principle. Here's how this goes, step by step: 

1. We know that the Federal government has limited powers. In particular, it does not have a general police power.

2. Sometimes, the government claims a power under the commerce clause and/or the necessary and proper clause, to do something that looks pretty far from its enumerated powers. Examples: forbid child labor in manufacturing, civilly commit sex offenders, forbid guns in schools, require people to buy health insurance.

3. When the government claims that power, it needs a *theory* of how the regulated activity affects commerce, or how the regulation is necessary and proper to effectuate its enumerated powers. For example, in *U.S. v. Lopez*, (part of) the government's theory could be summarized as follows: "gun violence in schools makes it harder for people to get an education, which creates a less educated workforce, which lowers national economic productivity, substantially affecting interstate commerce."

4. The government's theory typically can be generalized and applied to other cases. For example, a general statement of that *Lopez* theory might be "Congress can regulate any behavior that might, in the aggregate, make the workforce less productive."

5. Then the government is faced with a demand: **what principle limits that general theory?** The *Lopez* theory sounds like it might entitle the government to regulate anything: command people to get 8 hours of sleep a night, to go to the gym every day, to study math in school, etc. But we know, from (1), that the government doesn't have a general police power. Therefore, the government must be able to state a plausible **limiting principle** that yields concrete cases to which their theory from (4) would not extend. If it can do so, then it has shown that its theory doesn't "prove too much."^[For those of you with a philosophy or a rhetoric background, this is a style of argument analagous to the *modus tollens* or *reductio ad absurdum*.]

The demand for a limiting principle really comes home to roost in *Lopez*: if you [listen to the oral argument](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1994/93-1260) you'll hear the solicitor general^[*Solicitor general*: a high-ranking lawyer in the Justice Department who does the government's major oral arguments in the Supreme Court. Often the President puts someone in this position as the job before a Supreme Court nomination.] get slaughtered in oral argument by multiple justices repeatedly demanding he give them a limiting principle; he was unable to do so, and the majority opinion beats the government up like crazy for that. 

Justice Ginsburg is very careful, in her sorta-concurrence sorta-dissent in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, to explain the limiting principle on the power to compel participation in commerce, against Chief Justice Roberts's and the Joint Dissent's claim that accepting the individual mandate gives Congress unlimited power to, for example, command the consumption of broccoli.

The demand for a limiting principle is still controversial: those in the liberal wing of the court typically argue that the commerce and necessary and proper powers should be interpreted with a rational basis test, and with the chief constraint being the democratic process, not some fixed Congressional no-go zone... but they've lost the last few cases. 

## Where are we going?

In general, the *Lopez-Morrision-NFIB* rollback of commerce clause power and of the substantial effects test (which, to repeat, is still good law... it's just less clear how far it goes) seems to hinge on four ideas: 

1. The demand for a limiting principle.

2. Less deference toward Congressional judgments of what has a substantial effect. 

3. More caution about Congressional intrusion into areas like education, family life, and the control of violent crime that have been the traditional province of the states.

4. More caution about Congressional regulation of activities that do not seem conceptually "economic." This is particularly important in *Morrison*, where we see the suggestion that intrastate activity that Congress regulates under the commerce power must be "economic in nature," and the assertion that the substantial effects test does not apply to non-economic violent crimes.

Let's also remember that the extent of the rollback is highly uncertain. *Gonzalez v. Raich*, for example, looks like a resurgence of the old mid-20th-century commerce clause doctrine in 2005. As I've been emphasizing, this doctrine is in flux, and it's hard to predict where the law will go in the coming years---particularly with the death of Justice Scalia. 

## Summary of "black-letter principles"

If you're confronting a commerce clause question on the multistate bar exam, where you're expected to give some kind of mechanical answer, here's what you'd rely on: 

1. Commerce is essentially all interstate economic activity. It's not limited to "buying and selling" rather than "manufacture" or "transport."

2. Congress clearly has the power to regulate the "channels and instrumentalities" of interstate commerce.

3. Congress has the power to regulate intrastate economic activity if that activity, taken in the aggregate, has a "substantial effect" on interstate commerce. However, it is no longer clear that Congress has the power to regulate intrastate noneconomic activity on the same grounds (Lopez, Morrison).

4. Congress may use its power over the "channels and instrumentalities of interstate commerce" to get at intrastate and/or noneconomic activity that it doesn't like, by prohibiting, e.g., the use of interstate commerce to transport the products of forbidden goods.

5. Congress may regulate intrastate activity incidental and necessary to an interstate economic regulatory regime (*Raich*).

6. Congress does not have the power to compel participation in interstate commerce (*NFIB*).

Later, we'll see that there's also a "dormant commerce clause," which is about restricting state regulation in the area.

# Lopez hypo


Act of Congress: THE GUNS IN SCHOOL ZONES TAX
 
> Each person in the United shall pay a tax of $10,000 into the United States treasury each time she or he brings a gun into a school zone [as defined in the statute underlying Lopez]. This tax shall be reported and paid to the IRS with a person's ordinary income taxes.

Knowing, as we do from Lopez, that Congress can't forbid guns in school zones, should Congress be allowed to do an end-run around limitations on the commerce power by taxing them? Does it matter whether Congress intends, by so taxing, to deter the activity taxed, or whether it intends to raise revenue?  Does it matter whether the tax seems like a reasonable amount, or whether it's a ludicrous amount that nobody would ever voluntarily pay? 


\newpage

# Commandeering


The point of the anti-commandeering principle is simple: the federal government can't order about state and local governments in order to do its work.

This, **does not imply** that state and local governments are immune from regulation. Since Garcia v. San Antonio MTA, it's been well-established that Congress can impose ordinary laws on state and local governments, like minimum wages. 

What it can't do, however, is order the states to carry out governmental functions. For example, it can't command local police officers to enforce federal law, or command state legislatures to legislate.

Reno v. Condon, is about the distinction between these two kinds of regulation. This can be conceptually problematic, but doesn't pose a lot of real-world problems in day-to-day practice.

## Anti-Commandeering and Sanctuary Cities

The anti-commandeering principle is politically important right now. It's the principle that permits so-called "Sanctuary Cities"---where local law enforcement will not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts---to exist. Of course, their existence is controversial. 

One key statute is 8 U.S.C. §1373, which reads, in relevant part, as follows:

> (a) In general
> Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, a Federal, State, or local government entity or official may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.
>
> (b) Additional authority of government entities
> Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no person or agency may prohibit, or in any way restrict, a Federal, State, or local government entity from doing any of the following with respect to information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual:
> (1) Sending such information to, or requesting or receiving such information from, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
> (2) Maintaining such information.
> (3) Exchanging such information with any other Federal, State, or local government entity.

Consider the constitutionality of this law. May the federal government forbid a state from forbidding its officials from cooperating with the INS (ICE)? The statute purports to say to, for example, the state of California "you may not prohibit your police departments from keeping information about people's immigration statuses.  Is that consistent with *Printz v. United States*?

## Questions on the Tenth Amendment:

1.  Is the 10th Amendment an independent constraint on federal power, or just a redundancy? 

2.  20th century pattern: similar to that of the Commerce Clause, used as independent constraint on areas of Congressional regulation of citizens until post-new-deal period, where Court changed course. 

## Notes on the major cases

### New York v. United States

Consider the following **Hypo**

Congress passes a law requiring that producers of radioactive waste dispose of all their waste within their own state, in a facility guaranteed by the state to meet certain federal standards. If there's no such facility available for a producer, it may not engage in the activity that produces the waste.

If the answer is yes, how is that different from the issue before the Court? 

What else could Congress do to regulate in this area?  Are there any alternate routes to achieving its policy ends? 

What's the democratic argument the Court offers as normative support for its conclusion? Is it plausible?

Did the law in New York v. United States actually order the states to regulate? If not, what was the real problem?

### Prinz v. United States

Ask yourself: can state courts refuse to apply federal law? Is that different from the question in this case?  Why?

### Reno v. Condon

How is this case distinguished from *New York* and *Prinz*?

Footnote: the federal government can also impose (nondiscriminatory, proportionate) taxes on the states. See *Massachusetts v. United States*, 435 U.S. 444 (1978) (federal government may apply aircraft registration tax to state aircraft).


\newpage

# Commandeering hypos

(A)

Congress passes a law: no person may use the highways to transport any federal currency in denominations greater than $1000 across state lines.  Further, any state police officer who observes such an amount in a vehicle on the highways must attempt to ascertain its origin and, if there is probable cause to think it was transported over state lines, arrest the person and turn them over to the police. Constitutional? 

(B)

Congress passes a law: the "Radioactive Transit Passage Act of 2016," forbidding any person or entity who operates any roadway that is used in interstate commerce from discriminating against federally licensed nuclear waste carriers, and authorizing a private party to bring an administrative action before the interstate commerce commission to enforce it with both damages and injunctive relief.  The state of Iowa prohits the transport of nuclear waste on its highways, and Neds Nukes and Nail Cleaning, a federally licensed nuclear waste transport, files suit against the state for damages and an injunction.  

(C)

Congress passes the following law: 

"Any state official who arrests any person for a state drug offense must inform the United States Attorney of the arrest, so that the United States Attorney may prosecute such person for any relevant federal drug offenses." 

Further suppose that the federal government fully funds this (e.g., by establishing toll-free numbers to call), and that the state officials aren't obliged in any way to tell citizens that they're calling the feds.


\newpage

# Spending Clause

You'll notice that one of the powers of Congress is to tax and spend for the general welfare. And unlike the commerce power, this isn't bounded by subject area.

What this immediately suggests is that Congress can---and, you'll be totally unsurprised to learn, routinely does---spend money on lots of things that aren't otherwise within its powers. For an obvious example, the Department of Education spends tons of money on grants to local school districts to support various federal priorities. 

The immediate question the spending clause raises, given that many of these grants are given to state and local governments, is whether they can be used to coerce local officials to carry out federal law in ways that would otherwise be forbidden by the anti-commandeering principle.  

This, of course, is another politically fraught question, as one strategy that the current President has been planning against sanctuary cities is to take away their federal funding---in order to give them a strong incentive to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Here is a relevant excerpt from an executive order of January 25, 2017:

> In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary [of Homeland Security], in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary.  The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction.  The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.

A careful reading will suggest that this part of the order might not have very much in the way of teeth to it (how much federal money do the AG and secretary of homeland security have control over which aren't either distributed by law or deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes?), but let's suppose that it does. 

Suppose, for example, that a sanctuary city receives $10,000,000 in discretionary federal funds administered by the Attorney General. Further suppose that this represents 2/3 of the city's law enforcement budget, but that the AG concludes that it isn't "necessary" (obviously not using Justice Marshall's definition of "necessary").  Can the AG say, purusant to this executive order, "order your police to turn over information about undocumented people who have been picked up to ICE, or we take away the money?" Does it matter what the money is for? 

\newpage

# NFIB v. Sebelius

Obviously this is a really big case for us.  It actually ties together 100% of the federalism material we've seen thus far---the commerce clause, the necessary and proper clause, the taxing power, and the spending power used to commandeer. 

It will help to have a basic idea of the underlying statutory structure and the policy reasons behind it.  So here's the broad outline.

## Basics of the ACA

The Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. "Obamacare") was a systemic effort at reforming the health insurance system in the United States. Its key features were as follows:

1.  An "individual mandate" requiring everyone to get insurance on pain of a payment (to be characterized below).

2.  A variety of restrictions on the kinds of terms insurers can impose in policies.

3.  The establishment of "exchanges" in the states, either by the states or by the federal government itself, to allow people to buy health insurance (sometimes subsidized).

4.  The expansion of Medicaid, a federal+state funded, state administered program for providing insurance to the needy, and federal funding to go along with the expansion. A state that declined this expansion would lose existing Medicaid funding.

The overall project was to expand access to health insurance, expand the coverage of existing plans and reduce restrictions in them, and lower costs. 

Of those four key ideas, the first requires the most explanation. Why would the government want to require everyone to buy insurance, even if they don't want or need it? 

The answer requires detouring into a little bit of insurance economics.  

Imagine an insurance market with thee people in it, call them, in order of healthiness, Sick, Normal, and Crossfit. Each of them is going to have a different average yearly health care cost.  Let's suppose that the average cost of Sick's health care each year is $7,000; Normal's average yearly cost is $4,000, and Crossfit's average yearly cost is $1,000, mostly from having weights dropped on his/her feet.  

Let's suppose that all the people in the market know how healthy they are.  The insurance company knows *approximately* how healthy the people are, and does its best to charge people a little bit more than their average yearly cost. After all, that's how insurance works: you pay roughly your average cost, and in exchange, if you get hit by a bus and have to get millions of dollars of care, the insurance company has your back. 

However, the insurance company doesn't know quite as well as the individuals do how costly their lifestyles are.  So its estimates are going to be a little biased toward the average. Moreover, the law already prohibits some things that insurance companies could use to more accurately price people: it can't force you to get a genetic screening and the raise your price if you have predispositions to any diseases, it can't fly drones outside your window to monitor your diet... 

So the insurance company knows its average cost is $4,000.  It knows that Normal is about average, and it charges Normal $4,000.  It knows that Sick is a bit sicker than average, so it charges Sick, say, $6,500, and it knows that Crossfit is a bit healthier than average, so it charges Crossfit, say, $1,500. (Plus a small amount of profit in each case.)

So far so good. Except that Crossfit drops weights on his/her *foot* but not on his/her *head*.  So Crossfit is paying $1,500, and only getting about $1,000 in benefits. That's stupid. Crossfit cancels their insurance. 

All of a sudden, Insurance Company's costs go up to $5,500 on average. Since Crossfit was (effectively) subsidizing health insurance for Sick and Normal, their rates have to go up in order to keep Insurance Company in business. Suddenly Normal is getting charged more for the same insurance, and it's in Normal's interest to quit too.  And so on.

This problem is known to insurance economists as "adverse selection"---in an insurance market when the insured have better information than the insurers, the less risky (health insurance: less sick) tend to be paying more than they're getting back, and that tends to give them a reason to get out of the market.  But this is a process that can repeat itself (google "adverse selection death spiral"), and, in unfavorable markets, this can mean that ultimately the people left in the insurance market are the very risky, who are paying a lot. 

The point of the individual mandate is to put a stop to adverse selection. I'll be blunt: this is a form of economic redistribution. It directly subjects the healthy to charges that aren't in their economic best interests, in order to lower costs for the less healthy. 

There are also some secondary reasons for an individual mandate. One big problem is that people without insurance still get sick. And then many folks end up in emergency rooms (which are required to at least stabilize all comers without regard to ability to pay---this has been the law since 1986's Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act---see 42 U.S.C. §1395dd). The individual mandate is also meant to relieve this burden on emergency departments.

## The Challenge in NFIB

The plaintiffs in NFIB challenged the individual mandate and the medicaid expansion. 

With respect to the individual mandate, three theories were raised in defense of the provision:

1.  It's just an exercise of straight-up interstate commerce regulation. (After all, the health insurance market is national, and it's definitely economic activity.)

2. It's necessary and proper to the rest of the insurance regulation, as a means to the end of lowering rates for the poorest and sickets.

3.  The penalty that you pay if you don't get insurance is really just a tax. (If you're interested, it might benefit you to google "pigouvian tax.")

With respect to the medicaid expansion, the defense was straight-up spending clause, the claim of the challengers was that it was sufficiently coercive to amount to unconstitutional commandeering.
