# Notes on this Reader

This document compiles materials for the Northwestern Law Spring 2022 Constitutional Law class taught by Paul Gowder. 

This document and the Constitutional Law class assume a basic knowledge of the history and workings of the United States government at least at the level of an introductory college-level Political Science course such as "Introduction to American Politics." For students who lack this knowledge, some free resources that may be useful (I have not carefully reviewed these, and offer no warranties) include: 

- MIT's OpenCourseware (online lecture notes) for [an introductory American Politics course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/political-science/17-20-introduction-to-american-politics-spring-2013/).

- Videos and notes from Harvard University's [introduction to American Government on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/american-government-harvardx-hks101a-0).

- The open textbook, [American Government and Politics in the Information Age](https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/BookDetail.aspx?bookId=64).

For a deeper view, I would be remiss to not mention my own recently published book, *The Rule of Law in the United States: An Unfinished Project of Black Liberation*, which covers a significant amount of American constitutional history through an approximately critical race lens that focuses on the ongoing effort of Black Americans to obtain the protections of equal law. You can download an open access (that is, free) PDF from [https://rulelaw.us](https://rulelaw.us).

This cases in this collection were collected and edited by me for the purposes of this class. The edits are often, but not always, light (in that very little of the content is removed from many of the cases; some are effectively whole cases), but aggressive with respect to quotes and citations. In particular, I've tried to get rid of effectively all citation noise except where I think that seeing them is helpful to the learning process. Also, some of the citations were removed via automated tools written by a highly unprofessional programmer (me), which may have introduced errors.^[If you're really curious, and you happen to know some programming, you can see the numerous hacked-together python scripts that I threw at pieces of this at https://github.com/paultopia/casebook-14amend --- have fun!]  I've gone over the resulting text, and had TAs do so as well, but that doesn't preclude errors entirely. The possibility of quote and citation glitches is the tradeoff for not having to pay hundreds of dollars for a professionally copyedited casebook. 

Moreover, my edits are unmarked. As such, please do not rely on the text of cases in this reader for the accuracy of citations or quotes within cases. (Obviously, I expect you to rely on the text as a fair representation of the justices's arguments!) And if it looks like a Justice is just asserting some random fact, there's a very good chance that I cut out the citation.

This casebook/reader/thingy is entirely composed of U.S. Supreme Court cases (which are not subject to copyright) and materials written by me.

# The nature of Constitutional Law

## The subject matter of Constitutional Law and the coverage of our course

Constitutional law is the law that governs the government itself. 

Consider the distinction between "public law" and "private law."  Most of the 1L classes are "private law" in a strong sense: they govern people's relationships to each other. Thus, contract and property law govern the voluntary relationships people create with one another, and in contract law we sometimes even say that people make their own private law. Tort law, in that sense, governs the involuntary or unintentional relationships people have with one another.  

Criminal law and civil procedure are "public law" in a weak sense: they govern the relationship between people and the government. But the governing goes all in one direction: both criminal law and civil procedure involve the government ordering people not to do things (kidnap and kill in one case, file frivolous lawsuits in the other). The government itself isn't ordered to do things. 

By contrast, Constitutional law is about as public as public law gets, it's actually about *the government* being ordered about. In a sense, you can think of it as the flip side of criminal law: criminal law is the government ordering people about, and punishing them for wrongs against the public; Constitutional law is the people (as a democratic citizenry) ordering the government about, and suing it for wrongs against the law that governs its behavior.^[Administrative law shares this character, but to a lesser degree, since administrative law typically just orders about the executive branch, not, for example, Congress (who wrote it).] 

The word "Constitution" itself explains part of what Constitutional law does: it *constitutes*, that is, *establishes*, *forms* the United States Government. In that sense, the Constitution is the basic description of how the sovereign people of the United States have established their government---it decrees, for example, that federal statutes shall be passed by majorities of both houses of Congress and signed by the President, and in doing so establishes the only way that federal statutes get made---trying to enact a federal law some other way wouldn't work.^[We might not even say that enacting a law some other way would even be illegal, it might just be a *nullity*. Like, if I declare myself King Gowder I and start issuing decrees, we wouldn't say that I've handed down unconstitutional laws, we'd just laugh at me and say that I didn't hand down laws at all. But other kinds of things we say are real but unconstitutional. If the President tries to do a "line-item veto," for example, we say that he acts unconstitutionally---he tries to use the veto power, but in an impermissible way. You need to become comfortable with this kind of distinction, between what we might call an illegal act that's sort of within the broad territory of someone's authority but can be successfully challenged, versus an act that's so far outside the bounds of what law even colorably authorizes that it can just safely be ignored. You'll see these ideas in thinking about courts acting without jurisdiction too, and even in areas like family law, where we sometimes talk about a difference between a totally *void* marriage, like trying to marry your dog, and a *voidable* marriage, like a marriage entered into because of fraud. You don't need an annulment to get out of the marriage with Bruiser.]

Third, the U.S. Constitution is *higher law*. By this, I mean that it is the law that governs laws themselves, and not just their procedural enactment (like "laws must be passed by a majority of both houses of Congress"), but also their substance (like "laws may not establish an official religion"). If another law conflicts with the Constitution, that other law must give way. This hierarchy is itself expressed in the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.

The U.S. isn't the only country to have a constitution. Some of the ideas underlying constitutional government go back millennia. For example, Athens of the 4th century B.C. had a distinction between higher laws and mere decrees; even earlier it (arguably) had a form of judicial review. Some countries have constitutional principles without higher law or written documents. For example, in Britain, Parliament is considered sovereign and supreme: it can enact any law it pleases, even to the extreme of doing things like abolishing the monarchy, abandoning basic individual rights, changing the rules of its own elections, etc. However, British lawyers still understand there to be constitutional principles governing how Parliament may do so (forbidding it from---or at least limiting its powers to---enacting laws *retroactively*, for example).  To the extent the U.S. invented modern constitutional law, the real innovations were having one big written definitive document, having explicitly limited government (more on this in a moment), and having written individual rights in addition to allocations of government power.  

We can think of Constitutional Law as having two halves (though that won't track the allocation of our time, these are conceptual halves, not chronological hales). The first half is about the allocation of government powers within the government. When the President and Congress disagree about something, who wins? What about when the Supreme Court gets involved?  When the states and federal government disagree, who wins? The classical division of first half questions is into the domain of *federalism*---what the states get to decide, vs. what the feds get to decide---and the domain of *separation of powers*---what Congress gets to decide vs. what the President gets to decide vs. what the Supreme Court (& lower courts underneath it) gets to decide. 

Sometimes first half challenges to government action will come from other branches of government. For example, sometimes a state will sue the federal government claiming that the feds have intruded into territory left for the states. Very, very rarely, different branches of the federal government (or the personnel comprising same) can sue one another.^[For an example, see this story: [http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/obamacare-court-challenge-republicans/](http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/obamacare-court-challenge-republicans/).] But the vast majority of cases involve individuals (or companies, etc.) either suing the government to prevent the enforcement of some law, or defending lawsuits or criminal prosecutions from the government, either way on the grounds that the law the government seeks to enforce is beyond the scope of its authority---that the government, or particular branch of government, trying to boss someone around doesn't have the right to do so. 

By contrast, the second half of constitutional law is the law of substantive rights people have, that the government can't violate, even if the law or government action in question would otherwise be within the government's authority but for the right in question. These include both specific rights like free speech and freedom of religion, and more abstract individual-rights constraints on the government, like the principles of due process and equal protection of the laws. 

Each state has its own state constitutional law too, but we won't cover that here. We also won't cover the criminal stuff (4th Amendment, 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination, etc.). Those are beyond the scope of the traditional constitutional law course---the criminal stuff traditionally lives in your constitutional criminal procedure class or your 1L crim law class.  In addition, there are a number of doctrines within the scope of the traditional course that we won't have time to cover in depth, including the dormant commerce clause, privileges and immunities, sovereign immunity, and the First Amendment's speech clause, although some of these are briefly mentioned in the pages that follow.

These materials are also less historically oriented than most constitutional law casebooks. For example, most casebooks include *Lochner v. New York*, which famously expresses a now-discredited doctrine of individual economic rights. While we'll mention Lochner at the appropriate point, we won't read it, as I don't believe it's terribly useful for understanding contemporary doctrine and we simply don't have the time.


## Text + Supreme Court vs. Common Law and a Bunch of States

Another important fact about Constitutional Law is that it is not a common-law class. In torts or contracts or property you had a bunch of old rules, many of them passed down from middle-ages England and developed through the wisdom of time.^[Or folly, see e.g. the rule against perpetuities and the pure economic loss rule in negligence law.] There wasn't a single authoritative written source of those rules (except the UCC in contracts), instead there were a bunch of cases, that could be more or less persuasive. A state has authoritative rules in the form of the rulings of its highest court, but the U.S. in general just has "majority rules" and "minority rules," and states treat one another as persuasive authority only, not authority authority.

Constitutional law isn't like that. There's an authoritative (if vague-ish) text. That text says what the law is. And there is one high authority, the U.S. Supreme Court (though some people still disagree with that), that gets to interpret it (and boy oh boy does it take a lot of interpretation). So there's no "majority rule" or "minority rule," except when the Circuit Courts of Appeals have come to a different answer on something ("a circuit split").^[Of course, in those cases the Supreme Court often decides to hear the issue to resolve it. Federal law is supposed to be uniform.]

In some sense, this means that judges have less freedom. Common law is judge-made law, and while common law courts respect their own precedents, they're also free to change them when overwhelming policy considerations counsel doing so. By contrast, the Supreme Court has to obey the text. However, the Supreme Court can, and does, change its own interpretation of the text, and in doing so change Constitutional Law ("doctrine") without changing the Constitution itself.^[That's a controversial claim. Some professors essentially think that the Supreme Court does a kind of constitutional amendment.]

Because there's a text, we have to learn how to interpret text, as authoritative. Interpreting a Constitution or a statute is different from interpreting a case. In particular, we have a bunch of difficult and incredibly controversial questions about what we're trying to do when we interpret authoritative text. This is especially true when we get into ambiguous words (and they all get ambiguous if you poke at them enough). Are we trying to get at what the drafters (people like James Madison) *meant*? Are we trying to get at what ordinary people understand the text to mean? If so, which ordinary people---ordinary people today or ordinary people when it was written? Are we just trying to get at the "plain meaning" of the text? Do we use a dictionary?  

Another major feature of the Constitution, as opposed to ordinary statutes, is that the text is often written in terms of *values*. A statute might say "nobody may drive over 65 miles an hour," whereas the Constitution says things like "no cruel and unusual punishment." But "cruel" is a values word, just like the "unreasonable" in "unreasonable searches and seizures" and the "equal" in "equal protection of the laws." A court, in interpreting these Constitutional provisions, has to interpret the underlying *values* those words refer to. 

## The Idea of Limited Government

A (even *the*) key principle of Constitutional Law is that the federal government has *limited powers*---each branch, legislative, executive, judicial, has only the powers allocated to it by the Constitution (and those that follow by necessary implication), *nothing else*.

In particular, the federal government does not have a general power to do whatever it wants. Congress cannot legislate on any random subject it wants to: it can only legislate within the scope of its enumerated powers.

This means that there are two kinds of constitutional challenge to any Act of Congress.  Let's just call them *first half challenges* and *second half challenges*, to track the division noted above. 

A first half challenge is of the form "the Constitution does not grant Congress (or the President, etc.) the authority to act on this subject." For example, suppose Congress passed a "health and fitness" law, requiring every American to get a certain number of minutes of exercise per day. It's pretty clear that law would be unconstitutional: regulating people's exercise habits just isn't within the power of the federal government. This is a first half challenge.

By contrast, suppose Congress passes a law forbidding the sale of the Bible in interstate commerce. There's no first half challenge to this law---regulating interstate commerce is within Congress's enumerated power. But there's a big obvious second half challenge: the First Amendment forbids the government from tampering with freedom of religion.

As far as the federal constitution is concerned, there is no basic first half challenge to a state law. There might be second half challenges, or there might be first half-esque challenges based in state constitutions. In other words, as far as the federal constitution is concerned, the states have a *police power*---a term that just means "the general power to legislate for the public good" (it's not about cops specifically). That "police power" is exactly what the federal government does not have. 

The previous paragraph needs to be compromised a little bit, however, because there are some areas that the Constitution commits to the exclusive authority of the federal government. For example, only the federal government can declare war, the states have no such authority. If a state declares war, there will be a kind of first half challenge to that action, but not one rooted in the idea of limited and enumerated powers (the states don't have limited and enumerated powers, they have a general police power); rather, it's rooted in the fact that the Constitution took this power away from the states and gave it to the feds. (There are also many regulatory areas where the states and the federal government both have power.)

The individual branches of the federal government also have limited and enumerated powers that are subsets of the power of the whole. For example, even though the Constitution commits military command to the federal government, that doesn't mean that Congress can go out in the field and start ordering soldiers about. That's something that the Constitution allocates to the President.

## Some Basic Historical Facts

The Union started with the Articles of Confederation, ratified in 1781. It established a very weak central government, very strong states. Essentially the powers of the federal government were to conduct foreign relations and to resolve disputes between the states.

The main problems with the Articles were economic. First, no tax power. Accordingly, no public credit, and, even more dire, no resources for national defense. Second, no power over commerce between states, so states could, for example, impose import duties on one another, get into trade wars with another.

So in 1787, the framers basically went into a locked room and hashed it out. The Constitutional Convention wasn't actually planned by anyone. Basically, Virginia called a conference to talk about how much of a mess the Articles of Confederation were, and then at the conference everyone was like "let's rethink the whole thing." The Continental Congress eventually got with the program and authorized the convention to recommend revisions to the Articles... one view is that they had a fairly narrow charge, and they just went rogue and redid the whole thing.

The Constitution that came out of the process was very controversial. The states had lots of objections. Many thought the federal government was too powerful, many were upset by the absence of specific protections for individual rights (hence the Bill of Rights that got added right afterward). Lots of states ratified the Constitution with ratification statements saying, basically, "1, protect states rights better, 2. protect individual rights better."

The Federalist Papers, several of which we are reading in this course, were Madison, Hamilton and Jay's defense of the Constitution. They're very widely cited by contemporary Constitutional scholars and sometimes the Supreme Court as a way of getting at what the framing generation thought they were doing when they wrote and ratified the document. 

At the time, the political environment had two basic divisions---first the Federalists, who favored a strong central government (and, very roughly, a commercial economy). Exemplars include Alexander Hamilton and George Washington. Second the Anti-Federalists, who favored stronger states (and, again very roughly, a more agrarian economy). Exemplars include Thomas Jefferson. Madison started out a Federalist but later became a kind of de facto Anti-Federalist and close ally of Jefferson. One huge important issue right at the beginning was the creation of a National Bank---Hamilton was a major advocate, many states strongly opposed. The election of 1800 was a hugely important shift in early power from Federalists to Anti-Federalists.

Of course, the other huge division in the early United States was over slavery. In addition to the nascent moral opposition to slavery, it also gained political significance independent of the brutal oppression of the institution, because it also was part of the reason that the Southern states acted as a bloc to preserve their independent power and outsize influence in the national government (vestiges of which remain today). The constitution was biased in favor of southern states to such an extreme that abolitionists spoke of the "slave power" as an insidious force that controlled their government (and they weren't wrong) Of course, the most notorious example was the "three-fifths rule," which provided that slaves would be counted as 3/5 of a person for the purposes of Congressional representation---giving Southern states massively disproportionate representation in the House of Representatives, since they could import slaves, who were not given any of the rights of citizens, and then count them in getting more votes for the masters. The balance of Congressional power between slave and free states continued to influence national politics up to the Civil War, particularly in the question of whether new territories would be admitted as slave or free states. The Missouri Compromise was the most important example of how the fight over the relative influence of slave states or free states would infect the operation of the national government.^[Arguably, some of the protections for thinly populated agricultural states (and small states more generally) as against more densely populated states that would have an advantage in a strict one-person-one-vote electoral system (hence the Senate, and the apportionment of the Electoral College) could be included in the category of supports for slavery too, although given the size of states like Virginia at the founding this could be debated.] 

## Originalism, Living Constitution, etc.

There are two major theoretical camps about how the Constitution should be interpreted that you should be aware of.

1.  *Originalism* is the theory that the meaning of terms in the Constitution should be the meaning given to them by the framing generation. There are many varieties of originalism (it's a very fertile intellectual field), but the two key positions you should be aware of are: (a) the meaning is what the people who wrote/enacted it (i.e., Madison, Hamilton, etc., plus the other members of the Convention and the legislatures who ratified) thought they were enacting, and (b) the meaning is what the general public would have understood the words to mean at the time.  Generally, the second position ("original public meaning") is more popular today. The late Justice Scalia was one of the most important originalists in America; it's often (but not necessarily) associated with more conservative Justices and scholars. Originalists can be more "intentionalist," focusing on what people in the framing generation *meant* by what they wrote, or more "textualist," focusing on things like dictionary definitions and such from the framing generation. 

2.  The opposite position is often called *living constitutionalism*, but the label is mostly applied by its opponents (its proponents don't really have a term for it). Non-originalists/living constitutionalists think that the meaning of terms in the Constitution can change over time as social conditions change and the values of the American people change. It's typically associated with more liberal Justices and scholars, but, again, there's no particular reason that it has to be so associated. (Justice Kennedy, a Reagan appointee in the center of the court, was very living constitutionalist in his outlook).

Here's an example of how the two kinds of views might work. If a judge is trying to figure out whether a punishment violated the 8th Amendment's prohibition on "cruel and unusual punishments," an originalist judge would ask questions like "was this punishment customary in 1787?" and "was it considered cruel in 1787?" They'd use material like the statements of the framers, legislation in the First Congress and the states at the time of the founding, historical works on the extant practices of the criminal justice system in the 18th century, etc.  By contrast, a non-originalist judge would ask questions like "what is the best evidence about how much psychological damage this punishment inflicts?" and "have states and/or foreign countries over time moved to ban this practice?" That is, they'd ask about what our current standards are, what we understand today to be "cruel" and what is unusual today.

In reality, in practical constitutional arguments, both lawyers and courts deploy both originalist and non-originalist arguments when they happen to favor the position they think is correct.

## "Sovereignty"

The United States is a system of divided sovereignty between the federal and state governments. But fundamentally, of course, the sovereign is the People.  However, do the People exercise their sovereign authority primarily through the nation as a whole or through the states?  If you think the answer is "through the states," then you might have reason to support state claims of autonomy from federal authority; if you say the opposite, you might think the opposite.

Honestly, I think most of this talk about "sovereignty" as a theoretical concept is a bit of a distraction---at most, we might think that the framers had a theory of sovereignty and use it to interpret some ambiguous ideas in the Constitution---but it's hard to see why we might want to talk about *sovereignty* that way,  Consider *Bush v. Gore*, the infamous Supreme Court case that handed the 2000 election to the former by tinkering in how Florida counted its votes: does it really add anything to the debate about its permissibility to start talking about whether the People exercise sovereignty through Florida or through the United States or both?

# Doctrine and theory


Constitutional lawyers tend to understand how doctrine actually works by thinking about how it fits into overarching theories of the structure of rights and responsibility of government. 

For example, here's one way to think of the cases-and-controversies doctrines (advisory opinions, standing, mootness, ripeness---we'll delve into these very soon).  We want the federal courts to not waste their time on cases where there aren't real issues at stake, and, more importantly, when they develop legal doctrines, we want them to do so in a proper adversary context---that is, with real parties with real issues at stake before the court, who have the incentive to develop evidence and argument, as well as access to real evidence pertinent to the question. 

If we have that idea in the background, we can use it to more fully understand how the doctrines get applied.  For example: why did Massachusetts have standing to challenge the failure to regulate emissions leading to coastal erosion, while Defenders of Wildlife didn't have standing to challenge the failure to regulate federally funded foreign products leading to dead fluffy things?  Well, Massachusetts clearly had a much more concrete, real interest in keeping its lands from going back to the ocean---and it's reasonable to think that Massachusetts would have the capacity and incentive to do a much better job of putting forward evidence relating to the consequences of the EPA's failure to act, etc.^[Incidentally, this might also explain the court's maybe-dicta maybe-holding about the special role of states: a state generally has some interest in vindicating a broader set of legal rights than an individual does, as well as a generally greater capacity to produce good evidence and legal argument about such rights. This won't be clear to you now, but when you read the case it will.] 

Similarly, we might think that the political question doctrine is fundamentally about how the courts are not fit to decide pure policy questions that lack legal standards---those are the province of the elected branches, it's just not something courts are capable of doing. We might even think that entertaining policy questions would *corrupt* the courts and undermine their legitimacy: if courts are deciding, for example, on matters of war and peace that aren't amenable to legal resolution, then it compromises their role as neutral arbiters of the law, and undermines their credibility and legitimacy with the people---credibility and legitimacy that they need in order to enforce their rulings on actual legal questions against the other branches. 

Having that kind of "theoretical" understanding of the basis of the political question doctrine helps us see how it's applied in real cases. *Baker v. Carr* isn't a political question because the equal protection clause gives the court real legal standards, that aren't just policy judgments, to apply.  *Luther v. Borden* is because there aren't legal standards to apply, and because the Constitutional structure anticipates that the political branches will handle fundamental questions like "is group of people X the legitimate government of a state." 

## Less doctrine, more argument.

Students who come to constitutional law often find themselves frustrated by the fact that doctrine in the area is very open-ended---often, the Court seems to be acting more like a political force than a judicial body, and the arguments seem to be very malleable and easy to manipulate.  This is a feature of the terrain, and it can be especially jarring in the spring semester of 1L year, when students have just gotten accustomed to the whole doctrine thing through their fall courses---and then it gets taken away in conlaw.

The best way to deal with this is to view Supreme Court decisions as arguments, not as rules of law--and particularly, as arguments about how to apply, or whether to apply, the doctrinal framework that they tell us they're applying. And by putting ourselves in the places of the justices, and of litigants, we learn to apply constitutional modes of reasoning; the ultimate goal being to be able to make our own constitutional arguments, not in terms of little-respected black letter niceties which we can get out of a book, but in terms of the core principles that drive the area of law.

# Practical lawyering in Constitutional Law

## Three Modes of Argument

In constitutional law, we have three key modes of argument.  These modes also show up in other areas of law, but they look a bit different in this course, and different modes are emphasized in different ways in our cases. 

The three kinds of argument are:

1.  Fact based/common-law style

2.  Textual interpretation

3.  Goals/values based.

These are all kinds of arguments that show up in cases, and that you will deploy as practicing lawyers. By learning to spot and understand them in the cases we read, you also learn to make them effectively in your eventual practice of law.

### Common-law style

You should be most familiar with this mode of argument. In contracts, or torts, or property, you spent most of your time reading cases with slightly different facts and trying to figure out how and why those factual differences lead to legal (outcome) differences. In practice, you'll turn to doing the same thing as an advocate: arguing that some should be followed because their facts are similar to the facts of the cases you have, and the results are good for your clients, while arguing that some other cases should be distinguished because their facts are different from your facts, and their results are bad for your clients.

This shows up in constitutional law too, of course. Consider some standing cases: we can distinguish *Massachusetts v. E.P.A.*  from *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife* because in the one case the plaintiff had a relatively concrete/definite and imminent injury (the undermining of coastal land), while the plaintiff in the other did not (vague plans to maybe go see some animals one day, which would be undermined if the government let them go extinct).

Note that to carry out this kind of argument you have to be able to argue that the facts you rely on are *relevantly* similar or different. For example, you can't distinguish two cases because the plaintiff in one is a redhead and in the other is a blonde.

So why does the difference between Mass v. EPA and Lujan matter?  Sometimes, you can make this relevance argument because the court in a prior case will have explained it: the majority opinion will explicitly say "we make this holding because of fact X, and if it had been fact Y it would have come out differently for the following reasons."

Sometimes, however, you have to use one of the other modes of argument to fill out the case for why the facts that you want to be relevant actually are relevant. For example, you might want to argue that there's some kind of textual (mode 2) or normative (mode 3) basis for thinking that concrete and definite injuries are more appropriate as a basis of standing than less definite injuries.

### Textual Interpretation

Sometimes, you've got a written authoritative text, like a statute or the constitution---or sometimes a contract.  Then, your goal is often to resolve uncertainty about what the words in that text mean. For example, "is this a regulation of interstate commerce" sometimes requires not just factual comparision to prior cases but also knowing something about what "commerce" means in the given context.

For example, the Court in Marbury v. Madison parsed the text of Article III and concluded (in part) that because the text explicitly gave Congress the power to mess around with the Court's *appellate* jurisdiction, but said nothing about a similar power with respect to the Court's *original* jurisdiction, that Congress lacked that power.

Sometimes, you can make an argument from the "plain meaning" of those words. Other times, you can make use of conventional interpretive principles ("canons" or "maxims" of interpretation---like *expressio unius est exclusio alterius*, which is one way to read Marbury---the Constitution explicitly said that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction over X, Y, and Z, so it doesn't have jurisdiction over anything else).

More often, however, you'll have to make an argument about *people*. Words don't have meaning on their own, they only have meaning to human beings who use them, and many words have different meanings to different groups of people, in the different social contexts in which they find themselves.

This means that the interpretive argument is at least two arguments:

1.  Who counts?  If you're doing constitutional law, should we care about the meaning the framers gave the words, ordinary people at the time, ordinary people now, or whoever? If we're doing contract law, do we interpret the terms via trade usage or ordinary usage of the general public?

2.  How do we learn the meaning the people who count give to the words?  Do we look at dictionaries? Do we look at legislative history? Do we look at the Federalist Papers, at James Madison's letters, at contemporary opinion polls?

Again, we often have to bring other modes of argument to bear on answering these questions (all three are deeply intertwined): we might think that the framers count, for example, because we have normative commitments (mode 3) to an ideal of the rule of law that privileges legal stability and finding the intentions of authoritative lawmakers. We might also/instead use the actions of the framers (or whomever we care about) as common-law style precedent (mode 1) to figure out what meaning they give to the words in the text---if the First Congress enacted some law that depends on a controversial interpretation of the Necessary and Proper Clause, that gives us some reason to think that they understood the kind of law they enacted to be within the meaning of those words. (When we get there, try to find an argument like that in *McCulloch v. Maryland*!)

### Goals and Values

Finally, you sometimes have to appeal to explicitly purposive or normative ideas. Sometimes these are structural or conceptual: you might argue our Constitution, taken as a whole, creates a certain kind of balance of state and federal power, or a certain kind of balance of Congress and Presidential power, and then argue from that general claim to the result in a particular case.

Sometimes, these are also values-based. The Constitution explicitly incorporates normative ideas, and sometimes you need to make arguments about what those values mean. Sometimes, for example, a court will just say "we made X constitutional decision because decision Y would have been super-undemocratic"---only usually in much more long-winded terms.

This mode of argument shows up in other areas of law as well. Thus far in your law school careers, you've probably heard it referred to as "policy argument." Think, for example, about debates about what a reasonable person would do in tort law, or about efficient choices of damages in tort or in contract. It's fair to say, though, that the explicit goals and values-based arguments are much more prominent in constitutional law than your other courses.

Once again, this mode of argument is closely tied in with the others. As you might imagine, there's a lot of disagreement about these big questions of structure and values; in order to resolve them we often have to appeal to the other modes. Why, for example, should my opinion of what it means to make a decision that accords with democratic values trump yours, if we have equally plausible arguments? Well, one reason might be if we think we can read the authoritative text (mode 2) that way, i.e., because the framers or some other relevant group meant to write it in there.

### The Upshot

All of these modes of argument show up in our constitutional law cases. By the end of 1L year, your goal should be to become sufficiently fluent in all of them that you can both understand them in the cases and deploy them in advocating for your own positions. Much of what we do in this course will be practice for developing this fluency.
