    A–1–b.


      JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
      A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De
    partment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually
    dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner
    would otherwise be released.  We have
    previously examined similar statutes enacted under state
    law to determine whether they violate the Due Process
    Clause.  But this
    case presents a different question. Here we ask whether
    the Federal Government has the authority under Article I
    of the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment
    program or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a
    government “of enumerated powers.”  We conclude that the
    Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact §4248
    as “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the
    powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the Government of
    the United States.”
	
                                I
      The federal statute before us allows a district court to order the civil commitment of an individual who is currently “in the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,”
    §4248, if that individual (1) has previously “engaged or
    attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child
    molestation,” (2) currently “suffers from a serious mental
    illness, abnormality, or disorder,” and (3) “as a result of”
    that mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is “sexually
    dangerous to others,” in that “he would have serious diffi
    culty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child
    molestation if released.” 
	
	   In order to detain such a person, the Government (acting through the Department of Justice) must certify to a
    federal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi
    tions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually
    violent activity or child molestation in the past and that
    he suffers from a mental illness that makes him correspondingly dangerous to others. §4248(a). When such a
    certification is filed, the statute automatically stays the
    individual’s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the
    Government an opportunity to prove its claims at a hearing through psychiatric (or other) evidence.
	
       If the Government proves its claims by “clear and convincing evidence,” the court will order the prisoner’s con
    tinued commitment in “the custody of the Attorney General,” who must “make all reasonable efforts to cause” the
    State where that person was tried, or the State where he
    is domiciled, to “assume responsibility for his custody,
    care, and treatment.” If either State is willing to
    assume that responsibility, the Attorney General “shall
    release” the individual “to the appropriate official” of that State. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,
    neither such State will assume such responsibility,” then
    “the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment
    in a suitable [federal] facility.” 
	
	Confinement in the federal facility will last until either
    (1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point
    where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appropriate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re
    leased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his custody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be
    transferred to the custody of that State. 
	
In November and December 2006, the Government
    instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the
    Eastern District of North Carolina against the five respondents in this case. Three of the five had previously
    pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por
    nography, and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual
    abuse of a minor.
    With respect to each of them, the Government claimed
    that the respondent was about to be released from federal
    prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or
    child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a
    mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to others.
	
	Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil
    commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They
    claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, criminal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates
    the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,
    and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments.  They claimed that the statute denies them sub
    stantive due process and equal protection of the laws. They claimed that it violates their procedural due
    process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous
    ness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead
    of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  And, finally, they claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex
    ceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Constitution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause
    and the Necessary and Proper Clause. 
	
	
                                   II
       The question presented is whether the Necessary and
    Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority
    sufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that
    question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other
    provisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process
    Clause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circumstances. In other words, we assume for argument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit
    a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether
    the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated powers, may enact such a statute as well. On that assumption, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress
    legislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this
    conclusion on five considerations, taken together.
	
       First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress
    broad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200
    years ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn
    ment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated
    powers,” McCulloch, which means that
    “[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or
    more of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, (2000). But, at the same time, “a government, entrusted with such” powers “must also be entrusted with ample means for their execution.” McCulloch. Accordingly, the Necessary
    and Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s
    grants of specific federal legislative authority are accom
    panied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,
    or useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial
    exercise.” 

Marshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not
    mean “absolutely necessary.”  In language that has come to define the
    scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:
	
	
> Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” 

       We have since made clear that, in determining whether
    the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the
    legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,
    we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means
    that is rationally related to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated power. 
	
       Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal statute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must
    also “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. But as we have already stated, the present
    statute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution
    other than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue
    that is not before us. Under the question presented, the
    relevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are
    ‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end
    under the commerce power” or under other powers that
    the Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple
    ment. 

We have also recognized that the Constitution “addresse[s]” the “choice of means”
        “primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can
        be seen that the means adopted are really calculated
        to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of
        the relationship between the means adopted and the
        end to be attained, are matters for congressional determination alone.” 
		
		
       Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly
    about the creation of federal crimes beyond those related
    to “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies
    committed on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Nations,” nonetheless grants
    Congress broad authority to create such crimes.  And Congress routinely exercises its authority to
    enact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its
    enumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign
    commerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the
    general welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish
    post offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturalization, and so forth. 
	
	
	Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the enforcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance
    of its enumerated powers, “can cause a prison to be erected
    at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,
    and direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment
    under the laws of the United States shall be confined
    there.” 
	
    Moreover, Congress, having established a prison system,
    can enact laws that seek to ensure that system’s safe and
    responsible administration by, for example, requiring prisoners to receive medical care and educational training, and can
    also ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and
    visitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for
    example, creating further criminal laws governing entry,
    exit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to
    ensure discipline and security. 
	
       Neither Congress’ power to criminalize conduct, nor its
    power to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,
    nor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prisoners, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con
    gress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of
    those things in the course of “carrying into Execution” the
    enumerated powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the
    Government of the United States.” 
	
	Second, the civil-commitment statute before us constitutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related
    mental-health statutes that have existed for many decades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of
    related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s
    constitutionality. A history of involvement, however, can
    nonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a
    congressional statutory scheme, and, in particular, the reason
    ableness of the relation between the new statute and preexisting federal interests.
       Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long
    provided for their civil commitment. [history omitted] 
	
	
      In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States
    proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil
    commitment system. The Judicial Conference based its
    proposals upon what this Court has described as a “long
    study by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by
    Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members included
    Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal
    district and circuit judges” across the country as well as
    with the Department of Justice. The committee studied, among other
    things, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Prisons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the
    expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be
    dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no
    state will assume responsibility for their custody.”  The committee, hence the Judicial
    Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact
    “some provision of law authorizing the continued confinement of such persons after their sentences expired.”
	
    
	Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding
    civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually
    dangerous persons who are already in federal custody,
    even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of
    their criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Government is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus
    todian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to
    protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger
    federal prisoners may pose.  Indeed, at common law, one
    “who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to
    exercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent
    him from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to
    others.”  If a federal prisoner is infected with a communicable disease that threatens others, surely
    it would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Government to take action, pursuant to its role as federal
    custodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes) to release that individual among the general public, where
    he might infect others (even if not threatening an interstate epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of
    such an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,
    then how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”
    to confine an individual whose mental illness threatens
    others to the same degree?
	
       Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible
    federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal
    criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement
    constitutionally enumerated authority. Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal
    inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them
    to “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually
    violent conduct” would pose an especially
    high danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have reasonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s
    report) that a reasonable number of such individuals
    would likely not be detained by the States if released from
    federal custody, in part because the Federal Government
    itself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”
    by incarcerating them in remote federal prisons.  Here
    Congress’ desire to address the specific challenges identified in the Reports cited above, taken together with its
    responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence
    that a federal statute represent a rational means for implementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.
    
Fourth, the statute properly accounts for state interests.
    Respondents and the dissent contend that §4248 violates
    the Tenth Amendment because it “invades the province of
    state sovereignty” in an area typically left to state control.
 But the Tenth Amendment’s text is clear: “The powers not
    delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
    prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States
    respectively, or to the people.” The
    powers “delegated to the United States by the Constitution” include those specifically enumerated powers listed
    in Article I along with the implementation authority
    granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause. Virtually by
    definition, these powers are not powers that the Constitution “reserved to the States.” 
	
       Nor does this statute invade state sovereignty or other
    wise improperly limit the scope of “powers that remain with the States.” Post, at 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To
    the contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:
    The Attorney General must inform the State in which the
    federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” that he is
    detaining someone with respect to whom those States may
    wish to assert their authority, and he must encourage
    those States to assume custody of the individual. He must also immediately “release” that person
    “to the appropriate official of” either State “if such State
    will assume [such] responsibility.” And either State has the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the
    individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate
    transfer to State custody. Respondents contend that the States are nonetheless “powerless to prevent
    the detention of their citizens under §4248, even if detention is contrary to the States’ policy choices.” Brief for
    Respondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the
    most natural reading of the statute, and the Solicitor General acknowledges that “the Federal
    Government would have no appropriate role” with respect
    to an individual covered by the statute once “the transfer
    to State responsibility and State control has occurred.” 
	
       Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated
    Article I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the
    statutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the
    cautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference
    upon inference” in order to sustain congressional action
    under Article I, Lopez, respondents
    argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary
    and Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more
    than one step removed from a specifically enumerated
    power.  But this argument is irreconcilable with our precedents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that
    case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of
    a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac
    cused of robbing a United States Post Office. The underlying enumerated Article I power was
    the power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”  But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized
    in McCulloch, “the power ‘to establish post offices and post roads’
         . . . is executed by the single act of making the establishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power
         and duty of carrying the mail along the post road, from one post office to another. And, from
        this implied power, has again been inferred the right
        to punish those who steal letters from the post office,
        or rob the mail.” 
		
    And, as we have explained, from the implied power to
    punish we have further inferred both the power to imprison, and, in Greenwood, the federal
    civil-commitment power.

Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi
    ple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri
    we observed that “Congress has authority under the
    Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that
    it therefore “has corresponding authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”
    are not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public officers.” We then further held that,
    in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax
    payer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic
    power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the
    stolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from
    specific federal payments.”  Similarly, in United States v. Hall (1879), we held that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in
    furtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to
    the wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces
    and their dependents; and from that implied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to
    pass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro
    priated such pensions.
	
       Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress
    has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that
    might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,
    and also the additional power to imprison people who
    violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the additional power to provide for the safe and reasonable
    management of those prisons, and the additional power to
    regulate the prisoners’ behavior even after their release. Of course, each of those
    powers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and
    McCulloch, is ultimately “derived from” an enumerated
    power.
	
	Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on
    Congress a general “police power, which the Founders
    denied the National Government and reposed in the
    States.” As the Solicitor
    General repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, §4248 is
    narrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small fraction of federal prisoners.
    And its reach is limited to individuals already “in the
    custody of the” Federal Government. 
	
    Thus, far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing
    the Government’s legitimate interest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its prison
    system.
    



We take these five considerations together. They include: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,
    (2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,
    (3) the sound reasons for the statute’s enactment in light
    of the Government’s custodial interest in safeguarding the
    public from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)
    the statute’s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the
    statute’s narrow scope. Taken together, these considerations lead us to conclude that the statute is a “necessary
    and proper” means of exercising the federal authority that
    permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro
    priately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security
    of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected
    by the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution
    consequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.
	
    
	
**JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins in all but Part III–A–1–b, dissenting.** 

      No enumerated power in Article I, §8, expressly delegates to Congress the power to enact a civil-commitment
    regime for sexually dangerous persons, nor does any other
    provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other
    branches of the Federal Government with such a power.
    Accordingly, §4248 can be a valid exercise of congressional
    authority only if it is “necessary and proper for carrying
    into Execution” one or more of those federal powers actually enumerated in the Constitution.
      Section 4248 does not fall within any of those powers.
	  
    The Government identifies no specific enumerated power
    or powers as a constitutional predicate for §4248, and none
    are readily discernable. Indeed, not even the Commerce
    Clause—the enumerated power this Court has interpreted
    most expansively—can justify federal civil
    detention of sex offenders. Under the Court’s precedents,
    Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as
    sexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity
    may have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on
    interstate commerce [citing Lopez and Morrison]. That limitation forecloses any claim that §4248 carries
    into execution Congress’ Commerce Clause power, and the Government has never argued otherwise.
	
      This Court, moreover, consistently has recognized that
    the power to care for the mentally ill and, where necessary, the power “to protect the community from the dan
    gerous tendencies of some” mentally ill persons, are
    among the numerous powers that remain with the States. As a consequence, we have held that States may “take measures to
    restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—including those who are sexually dangerous—provided
    that such commitments satisfy due process and other constitutional requirements. 
	
      Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil
    commitment laws that States have enacted under their
    parens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is
    clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s
    arguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is
    aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,
    not toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated
    power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam
    Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.
    587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual
    exploitation and violent crime”), §102,  (state
    ment of purpose declaring that the Act was promulgated
    “to protect the public from sex offenders”); Brief for United
    States 38–39 (asserting the Federal Government’s power
    to “protect the public from harm that might result upon
    these prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise
    from conduct that is otherwise beyond the general regulatory powers of the federal government” 
	
    
	The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed
    authority to “criminalize conduct” that interferes with
    enumerated powers; to “imprison individuals who engage
    in that conduct”; to “enact laws governing [those] prisons”;
    and to serve as a “custodian of its prisoners.”  From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be
    a valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘reasonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden
    tal—and thus unenumerated—authorities.  But that is not the question. The Necessary and
    Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to
    enact any law simply because it furthers other laws Congress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental authority; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every
    federal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of
    the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.
	
Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes
    with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who
    engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and
    treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal
    sentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]
    into Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a
    criminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,
    Congress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices
    and post Roads” would lack force or practical effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact criminal laws “to punish those who steal letters from the post
    office, or rob the mail.” Similarly, that enumerated power would be compromised if
    there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those
    laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that
    prisoners could escape or demand their release on the
    grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate
    their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined
    them.  Civil detention under §4248, on the other hand, lacks any
    such connection to an enumerated power.
     
    After focusing on the relationship between §4248 and
    several of Congress’ implied powers, the Court finally
    concludes that the civil detention of a “sexually dangerous
    person” under §4248 carries into execution the enumer
    ated power that justified that person’s arrest or conviction
    in the first place. In other words, the Court analogizes
    §4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care
    for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await
    trial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”
    the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of
    criminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that
    essential characteristic for three reasons.

First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous
    person” contains no element relating to the subject’s
    crime. It thus does not require a
    federal court to find any connection between the reasons
    supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power
    with which that person’s criminal conduct interfered. As a
    consequence, §4248 allows a court to civilly commit an
    individual without finding that he was ever charged with
    or convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence. That possibility is not merely hypothetical:
    The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals
    against whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit
    this description.
	
	   Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commitment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted prisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the statute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run. The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a
    person at a time when the Government would lack jurisdiction to detain him for violating a criminal law that
    executes an enumerated power. The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United
    States, provides a useful contrast. That statute authorized the Federal Government to exercise civil custody over a federal defendant declared mentally unfit to stand trial only “until the accused shall be
    mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending
    charges against him are disposed of according to law.” Thus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted
    as preserving the Government’s power to enforce a criminal law against the accused. Section 4248,
    however, authorizes federal detention of a person even
    after the Government loses the authority to prosecute him
    for a federal crime.
   
   Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”
    relevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that
    the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumerated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern
    ment has no express power to regulate sexual violence
    generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscribing such conduct in special circumstances. All of these
    statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a
    connection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers, such
    as interstate commerce, or that limit the
    statute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has
    plenary authority. Section 4248, by contrast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that
    the person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to
