# Interlude: nonaquiescence


At various points in recent history, the Social Security Administration has had a "nonacquiescence" policy. On that policy, if a Circuit Court made a ruling interpreting social security law (such as the standards for who is disabled) that the SSA disagreed with, it obeyed it in the specific case---for example, it paid the benefits it was been ordered to pay---but did not apply it in subsequent cases, even within the same circuit. Under immense political pressure, plus the threat of contempt sanctions, the SSA backed down from that policy. But should it have had? Or was the policy permissible?
