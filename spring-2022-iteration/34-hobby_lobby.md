# Burwell v. Hobby Lobby

(TODO: remove leading whitespace)

573 U.S. 682 (2014)

**JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court.**


      We must decide in these cases whether the Religious
    Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. §2000bb et seq., permits the United States
    Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to
    demand that three closely held corporations provide
    health-insurance coverage for methods of contraception
    that violate the sincerely held religious beliefs of the
    companies’ owners. We hold that the regulations that
    impose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action
    constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest.
	
	The owners of the businesses have religious objections to
    abortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four
    contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients. If the
    owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they
    will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply,
    they will pay a very heavy price—as much as $1.3 million
    per day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one
    of the companies. If these consequences do not amount to
    a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.
    
	Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a
    substantial burden on religious exercise must serve a
    compelling government interest, and we assume that the
    HHS regulations satisfy this requirement. But in order
    for the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least restrictive means of serving that interest,
    and the mandate plainly fails that test. There are other
    ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that
    every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved
    contraceptives.
    
	In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a
    system that seeks to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to
    all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage. The employees of these religious nonprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage
    without cost sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net
    economic burden on the insurance companies that are
    required to provide or secure the coverage.
	
       Although HHS has made this system available to religious nonprofits that have religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the
    same system cannot be made available when the owners of
    for-profit corporations have similar religious objections.
    We therefore conclude that this system constitutes an
    alternative that achieves all of the Government’s aims
    while providing greater respect for religious liberty. And
    under RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of
    the HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting
    parties in these cases is unlawful.
	
    
	Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very
    broad protection for religious liberty. RFRA’s enactment
    came three years after this Court’s decision in Employment Div.. v. Smith, which largely repudiated the method of
    analyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in cases
    like Sherbert v. Verner and Wisconsin v. Yoder.
	
       Congress responded to Smith by enacting RFRA.
    “[L]aws [that are] ‘neutral’ toward religion,” Congress
    found, “may burden religious exercise as surely as laws
    intended to interfere with religious exercise.” In order to ensure
    broad protection for religious liberty, RFRA provides that
    “Government shall not substantially burden a person’s
    exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule
    of general applicability.” If the Govern-
    ment substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion,
    under the Act that person is entitled to an exemption from
    the rule unless the Government “demonstrates that appli-
    cation of the burden to the person—(1) is in furtherance of
    a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least
    restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.” §2000bb–1(b).3

      As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere
    religious belief that life begins at conception. They there-
    fore object on religious grounds to providing health insur-
    ance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS
    acknowledges may result in the destruction of an embryo. By requiring
    the Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for
    such coverage, the HHS mandate demands that they
    engage in conduct that seriously violates their religious
    beliefs.
	
      If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not
    yield to this demand, the economic consequences will be
    severe. If the companies continue to offer group health
    plans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they
    will be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual.  For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount
    to $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for
    Conestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or
    $33 million per year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000
    per day or about $15 million per year. These sums are
    surely substantial.
	
      It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assess-
    ments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus
    forcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one
    of the exchanges established under ACA. But if at least
    one of their full-time employees were to qualify for a sub-
    sidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course
    would also entail substantial economic consequences. The
    companies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee
    each year. These penalties would amount to
    roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for
    Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.
  
  
  In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not
    impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion,
    HHS’s main argument (echoed by the principal dissent) is
    basically that the connection between what the objecting
    parties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for
    four methods of contraception that may operate after the
    fertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be
    morally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too
    attenuated.  HHS and the dissent note that providing the
    coverage would not itself result in the destruction of an
    embryo; that would occur only if an employee chose to take
    advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four meth-
    ods at issue.
	
	This argument is not easy to square with the position taken by  HHS in providing exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for
    religious employers, such as churches, that have the very same reli-
    gious objections as the Hahns and Greens and their companies. The
    connection between what these religious employers would be required to do if not exempted (provide insurance coverage for particular contra-
    ceptives) and the ultimate event that they find morally wrong (destruc-
    tion of an embryo) is exactly the same. Nevertheless, as discussed,
    HHS and the Labor and Treasury Departments authorized the exemp-
    tion from the contraceptive mandate of group health plans of certain
    religious employers, and later expanded the exemption to include
    certain nonprofit organizations with religious objections to contracep-
    tive coverage. When this was done, the Govern-
    ment made clear that its objective was to “protec[t]” these religious
    objectors “from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for such
    coverage.” Those exemptions would be hard to understand if the
    plaintiffs’ objections here were not substantial.

[I]n these cases, the Hahns and Greens and
    their companies sincerely believe that providing the in-
    surance coverage demanded by the HHS regulations lies
    on the forbidden side of the line, and it is not for us to say
    that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.
    Instead, our “narrow function . . . in this context is to determine” whether the line drawn reflects “an honest conviction,” and there is no dispute that it
    does.

HHS nevertheless compares these cases to decisions in
    which we rejected the argument that the use of general
    tax revenue to subsidize the secular activities of religious
    institutions violated the Free Exercise Clause.  But in those cases, while the subsidies
    were clearly contrary to the challengers’ views on a secular issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the challengers never articulated a religious objection to the subsidies. As we put it in Tilton, they were “unable to
    identify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of
    their religious beliefs.” 
	
	Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs do assert that funding the specific
    contraceptive methods at issue violates their religious
    beliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity. Be-
    cause the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an
    enormous sum of money—as much as $475 million per
    year in the case of Hobby Lobby—if they insist on provid-
    ing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious
    beliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden
    on those beliefs.
    
	Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a sub-
    stantial burden on the exercise of religion, we must move
    on and decide whether HHS has shown that the mandate
    both “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental
    interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of further-
    ing that compelling governmental interest.” 

HHS asserts that the contraceptive mandate serves a
    variety of important interests, but many of these are
    couched in very broad terms, such as promoting “public
    health” and “gender equality.” RFRA, however, contemplates a “more
    focused” inquiry: It “requires the Government to demon-
    strate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through
    application of the challenged law ‘to the person’—the
    particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is
    being substantially burdened.” This requires us to
    “loo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests” and to “scru-
    tiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions
    to particular religious claimants”—in other words, to look
    to the marginal interest in enforcing the contraceptive
    mandate in these cases. 
	
	In addition to asserting these very broadly framed
    interests, HHS maintains that the mandate serves a
    compelling interest in ensuring that all women have ac-
    cess to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost
    sharing.  Under our cases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to
    obtain contraceptives, see Griswold v. Connecticut,  and HHS tells us that “[s]tudies
    have demonstrated that even moderate copayments for
    preventive services can deter patients from receiving those
    services.” 
	
	
       The objecting parties contend that HHS has not shown
    that the mandate serves a compelling government interest, and it is arguable that there are features of ACA that
    support that view. As we have noted, many employees---those covered by grandfathered plans and those who work
    for employers with fewer than 50 employees---may have no
    contraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all.
	
       HHS responds that many legal requirements have
    exceptions and the existence of exceptions does not in
    itself indicate that the principal interest served by a law is
    not compelling. Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier
    consideration. In these cases, however, the interest served
    by one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for grandfathered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoid-
    ing the inconvenience of amending an existing plan.
    Grandfathered plans are required “to comply with a subset
    of the Affordable Care Act’s health reform provisions” that
    provide what HHS has described as “particularly signifi-
    cant protections.” But the
    contraceptive mandate is expressly excluded from this
    subset. 

We find it unnecessary to adjudicate this issue. We will
    assume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access
    to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling
    within the meaning of RFRA, and we will proceed to con-
    sider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether HHS
    has shown that the contraceptive mandate is “the least
    restrictive means of furthering that compelling govern-
    mental interest.” 
	
The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally
    demanding, and it is
    not satisfied here. HHS has not shown that it lacks other
    means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a
    substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting parties in these cases. 
	
       The most straightforward way of doing this would be for
    the Government to assume the cost of providing the four
    contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to
    obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to
    their employers’ religious objections. This would certainly
    be less restrictive of the plaintiffs’ religious liberty, and
    HHS has not shown that this is not a
    viable alternative. 
	
	
In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a
    new, government-funded program in order to conclude
    that the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means
    test. HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its dis-
    posal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring
    employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their
    religious beliefs. As we explained above, HHS has already
    established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations
    with religious objections. 
	
    Under that accommodation, the organization can self-
    certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular
    contraceptive services. If the organization
    makes such a certification, the organization’s insurance
    issuer or third-party administrator must “[e]xpressly
    exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health
    insurance coverage provided in connection with the group
    health plan” and “[p]rovide separate payments for any
    contraceptive services required to be covered” without
    imposing “any cost-sharing requirements . . . on the eligi-
    ble organization, the group health plan, or plan partici-
    pants or beneficiaries.” 
    
	
**JUSTICE GINSBURG, with whom JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR  joins, and with whom JUSTICE BREYER and JUSTICE KAGAN join as to all but Part III–C–1, dissenting.**
       In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that
    commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with
    partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any
    law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with
    their sincerely held religious beliefs. See ante, at 16–49.
    Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance
    with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-
    outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at
    least when there is a “less restrictive alternative.” And
    such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will
    be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a

    religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general
    public, can pick up the tab. See ante, at 41–43.1
       The Court does not pretend that the First Amendment’s
    Free Exercise Clause demands religion-based accommoda-
    tions so extreme, for our decisions leave no doubt on that
    score. See infra, at 6–8. Instead, the Court holds that
    Congress, in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
    1993 (RFRA), 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §2000bb et seq., dictated the
    extraordinary religion-based exemptions today’s decision
    endorses. In the Court’s view, RFRA demands accommo-
    dation of a for-profit corporation’s religious beliefs no
    matter the impact that accommodation may have on third
    parties who do not share the corporation owners’ religious
    faith—in these cases, thousands of women employed by
    Hobby Lobby and Conestoga or dependents of persons
    those corporations employ. Persuaded that Congress
    enacted RFRA to serve a far less radical purpose, and
    mindful of the havoc the Court’s judgment can introduce, I

    tion extended, the Court asserts, “women would still be entitled to all
    [Food and Drug Administration]-approved contraceptives without cost
    sharing.” Ante, at 4. In the end, however, the Court is not so sure. In
    stark contrast to the Court’s initial emphasis on this accommodation, it
    ultimately declines to decide whether the highlighted accommodation is
    even lawful. See ante, at 44 (“We do not decide today whether an

    ing when, as part of a nationwide insurance program
    intended to be comprehensive, it called for coverage of
    preventive care responsive to women’s needs. Carrying
    out Congress’ direction, the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS), in consultation with public health
    experts, promulgated regulations requiring group health
    plans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the
    Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The genesis of this
    coverage should enlighten the Court’s resolution of these
    cases.
                                 A
       The Affordable Care Act (ACA), in its initial form, speci-
    fied three categories of preventive care that health plans
    must cover at no added cost to the plan participant or
    beneficiary.2 Particular services were to be recommended
    by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independ-
    ent panel of experts. The scheme had a large gap, how-
    ever; it left out preventive services that “many women’s
    health advocates and medical professionals believe are
    critically important.” 155 Cong. Rec. 28841 (2009) (state-
    ment of Sen. Boxer). To correct this oversight, Senator
    Barbara Mikulski introduced the Women’s Health
    Amendment, which added to the ACA’s minimum coverage
    requirements a new category of preventive services specific
    to women’s health.
       Women paid significantly more than men for preventive
    care, the amendment’s proponents noted; in fact, cost

    (statement of Sen. Mikulski) (“co-
    payments are [often] so high that [women] avoid getting

    And increased access to contraceptive services, the spon-
    sors comprehended, would yield important public health
    gains. See, e.g.,

    vast majority of [the 17 million women of reproductive age
    in the United States who are uninsured] . . . . This ex-
    panded access will reduce unintended pregnancies.”).
       As altered by the Women’s Health Amendment’s pas-
    sage, the ACA requires new insurance plans to include
    coverage without cost sharing of “such additional preven-
    tive care and screenings . . . as provided for in comprehen-
    sive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and
    Services Administration [(HRSA)],” a unit of HHS.

    consequences of excluding contraception from preventive
    care available to employees without cost sharing. See,

    the other filed by Conestoga and the family that owns and controls that

    missed from their jobs and denied unemployment benefits
    because they ingested peyote at, and as an essential ele-
    ment of, a religious ceremony. Oregon law forbade the
    consumption of peyote, and this Court, relying on that
    prohibition, rejected the employees’ claim that the denial
    of unemployment benefits violated their free exercise
    rights. The First Amendment is not offended, Smith held,
    when “prohibiting the exercise of religion . . . is not the
    object of [governmental regulation] but merely the inci-
    dental effect of a generally applicable and otherwise valid
    provision.”

    State is free to regulate”). The ACA’s contraceptive cover-
    age requirement applies generally, it is “otherwise valid,”
    it trains on women’s well being, not on the exercise
    of religion, and any effect it has on such exercise is
    incidental.
      Even if Smith did not control, the Free Exercise Clause
    would not require the exemption Hobby Lobby and Cones-
    toga seek. Accommodations to religious beliefs or obser-
    vances, the Court has clarified, must not significantly
    impinge on the interests of third parties.8

    ling interest test is “workable” and “strike[s] sensible
    balances”).
       The legislative history is correspondingly emphatic on
    RFRA’s aim. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 103–111, p. 12 (1993)
    (hereinafter Senate Report) (RFRA’s purpose was “only to
    overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in Smith,” not to
    “unsettle other areas of the law.”); 139 Cong. Rec. 26178
    (1993) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) (RFRA was “designed
    to restore the compelling interest test for deciding free
    exercise claims.”). In line with this restorative purpose,
    Congress expected courts considering RFRA claims to
    “look to free exercise cases decided prior to Smith for
    guidance.” Senate Report 8. See also H. R. Rep. No. 103–
    88, pp. 6–7 (1993) (hereinafter House Report) (same). In
    short, the Act reinstates the law as it was prior to Smith,
    without “creat[ing] . . . new rights for any religious prac-
    tice or for any potential litigant.” 139 Cong. Rec. 26178

    and a voice vote in the House of Representatives).
                                   B
       Despite these authoritative indications, the Court sees
    RFRA as a bold initiative departing from, rather than
    restoring, pre-Smith jurisprudence. See ante, at 6, n. 3, 7,
    17, 25–27. To support its conception of RFRA as a meas-
    ure detached from this Court’s decisions, one that sets a
    new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land
    Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),
    

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §2000cc et seq., which altered RFRA’s defini-
    tion of the term “exercise of religion.” RFRA, as originally
    enacted, defined that term to mean “the exercise of reli-
    gion under the First Amendment to the Constitution.”
    §2000bb–2(4) (1994 ed.). See ante, at 6–7. As amended by
    RLUIPA, RFRA’s definition now includes “any exercise of
    religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a
    system of religious belief.” §2000bb–2(4) (2012 ed.) (cross-
    referencing §2000cc–5). That definitional change, accord-
    ing to the Court, reflects “an obvious effort to effect a
    complete separation from First Amendment case law.”
    Ante, at 7.
       The Court’s reading is not plausible. RLUIPA’s altera-
    tion clarifies that courts should not question the centrality
    of a particular religious exercise. But the amendment in
    no way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class
    of entities qualified to mount religious accommodation
    claims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to in-
    quire whether a government action substantially burdens
    a religious exercise. See Rasul v. Myers, 

563 F.3d 527

    
    
    ,
    535 (CADC 2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (“There is no

    bition that the ‘[g]overnment shall not substantially bur-
    den a person’s exercise of religion.’ ”).10
      Next, the Court highlights RFRA’s requirement that the
    government, if its action substantially burdens a person’s
    religious observance, must demonstrate that it chose the
    least restrictive means for furthering a compelling inter-
    est. “[B]y imposing a least-restrictive-means test,” the
    Court suggests, RFRA “went beyond what was required by
    our pre-Smith decisions.” Ante, at 17, n. 18 (citing City of
    Boerne v. Flores, 

[521 U.S. 507 ](/opinion/118140/city-of-boerne-v-flores/)

    
    
    (1997)). See also ante, at 6,
    n. 3. But as RFRA’s statements of purpose and legislative
    history make clear, Congress intended only to restore, not
    to scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had
    applied it pre-Smith. 

See supra, at 8

    
    
    –9. See also Senate
    Report 9 (RFRA’s “compelling interest test generally
    should not be construed more stringently or more leniently
    than it was prior to Smith.”); House Report 7 (same).
      The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this
    Court’s pre-Smith case law as including within the “com-
    pelling interest test” a “least restrictive means” require-
    ment. See, e.g., Senate Report 5 (“Where [a substantial]
    burden is placed upon the free exercise of religion, the
    Court ruled [in Sherbert], the Government must demon-

      10 RLUIPA, the Court notes, includes a provision directing that “[t]his
    
    chapter [i.e., RLUIPA] shall be construed in favor of a broad protection

    [the Act] and the Constitution.”

    6–7, 26. RFRA incorporates RLUIPA’s definition of “exercise of reli-

    governing the statute in its entirety.

    strate that it is the least restrictive means to achieve a
    compelling governmental interest.”). And the view that
    the pre-Smith test included a “least restrictive means”
    requirement had been aired in testimony before the Sen-
    ate Judiciary Committee by experts on religious freedom.
    See, e.g., Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee
    on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 78–79 (1993)

       Our decision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the
    least restrictive means requirement “was not used in the
    pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.” See
    ante, at 6, n. 3, 17, n. 18. As just indicated, however, that
    statement does not accurately convey the Court’s pre-
    Smith jurisprudence. See

    view of the positions taken by the Court, requires consid-

    Hobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s claims: Do for-profit corpo-
    rations rank among “person[s]” who “exercise . . . reli-
    gion”? Assuming that they do, does the contraceptive
    coverage requirement “substantially burden” their reli-
    gious exercise? If so, is the requirement “in furtherance of

    requirement represent the least restrictive means for

    support for the notion that free exercise rights pertain to
    for-profit corporations.
      Until this litigation, no decision of this Court recognized
    a for-profit corporation’s qualification for a religious ex-
    emption from a generally applicable law, whether under
    the Free Exercise Clause or RFRA.13 The absence of such
    precedent is just what one would expect, for the exercise of
    religion is characteristic of natural persons, not artificial
    legal entities. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly
    two centuries ago, a corporation is “an artificial being,

    law.” Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,

    Court has indeed recognized, shelter churches and other
    nonprofit religion-based organizations.14 “For many indi-
    viduals, religious activity derives meaning in large meas-
    ure from participation in a larger religious community,”
    and “furtherance of the autonomy of religious organiza-
    tions often furthers individual religious freedom as well.”

       15 Typically, Congress has accorded to organizations religious in char-
    
    acter religion-based exemptions from statutes of general application.
    E.g., 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §2000e–1(a) (Title VII exemption from prohibition
    against employment discrimination based on religion for “a religious
    corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect
    to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform
    work connected with the carrying on . . . of its activities”); 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §12113(d)(1) (parallel exemption in Americans With Disabilities Act of
    1990). It can scarcely be maintained that RFRA enlarges these exemp-
    tions to allow Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to hire only persons who
    share the religious beliefs of the Greens or Hahns. Nor does the Court
    suggest otherwise. Cf. ante, at 28.
       The Court does identify two statutory exemptions it reads to cover
    for-profit corporations, 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§300a–7(b)(2) and 238n(a), and
    infers from them that “Congress speaks with specificity when it intends
    a religious accommodation not to extend to for-profit corporations,”
    ante, at 28. The Court’s inference is unwarranted. The exemptions the
    Court cites cover certain medical personnel who object to performing or
    assisting with abortions. Cf. ante, at 28, n. 27 (“the protection provided
    by §238n(a) differs significantly from the protection provided by

    exemptions had never been extended to any entity operat-

       The reason why is hardly obscure. Religious organiza-
    tions exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to
    the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations.
    Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations
    commonly are not drawn from one religious community.
    Indeed, by law, no religion-based criterion can restrict the

    RFRA”). Notably, the Court does not assert that these exemptions have
    in fact been afforded to for-profit corporations. See §238n(c) (“health
    care entity” covered by exemption is a term defined to include “an
    individual physician, a postgraduate physician training program, and a
    participant in a program of training in the health professions”); Tozzi,

    of State Constitutional Free Exercise Clause Jurisprudence?, 48 J.
    Catholic Legal Studies 269, 296, n. 133 (2009) (“Catholic physicians,
    but not necessarily hospitals, . . . may be able to invoke [§238n(a)]
    . . . .”); cf. S. 137, 113th Cong., 1st Sess. (2013) (as introduced) (Abortion
    Non-Discrimination Act of 2013, which would amend the definition of
    “health care entity” in §238n to include “hospital[s],” “health insurance
    plan[s],” and other health care facilities). These provisions are reveal-
    ing in a way that detracts from one of the Court’s main arguments.
    They show that Congress is not content to rest on the Dictionary Act
    when it wishes to ensure that particular entities are among those
    eligible for a religious accommodation.
        Moreover, the exemption codified in §238n(a) was not enacted until
    three years after RFRA’s passage. See Omnibus Consolidated Rescis-
    sions and Appropriations Act of 1996, §515, 110 Stat. 1321–245. If, as
    the Court believes, RFRA opened all statutory schemes to religion-
    based challenges by for-profit corporations, there would be no need for a
    statute-specific, post-RFRA exemption of this sort.
        16 That is not to say that a category of plaintiffs, such as resident
    
    aliens, may bring RFRA claims only if this Court expressly “addressed
    their [free-exercise] rights before Smith.” Ante, at 27. Continuing with
    the Court’s example, resident aliens, unlike corporations, are flesh-and-
    blood individuals who plainly count as persons sheltered by the First
    Amendment, see United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,

    VII requires reasonable accommodation of an employee’s
    religious exercise, but such accommodation must not come
    “at the expense of other[ employees]”). The distinction
    between a community made up of believers in the same
    religion and one embracing persons of diverse beliefs, clear
    as it is, constantly escapes the Court’s attention.17 One
    can only wonder why the Court shuts this key difference
    from sight.
       Reading RFRA, as the Court does, to require extension
    of religion-based exemptions to for-profit corporations
    surely is not grounded in the pre-Smith precedent Con-
    gress sought to preserve. Had Congress intended RFRA to
    initiate a change so huge, a clarion statement to that
    effect likely would have been made in the legislation. See

    cases cited in House or Senate Judiciary Committee
    reports accompanying RFRA, or mentioned during floor
    speeches, recognized the free exercise rights of for-profit
    corporations).
       The Court notes that for-profit corporations may sup-
    port charitable causes and use their funds for religious
    ends, and therefore questions the distinction between such
    corporations and religious nonprofit organizations. See
    ante, at 20–25. See also ante, at 3 (KENNEDY, J., concur-
    ring) (criticizing the Government for “distinguishing be-
    tween different religious believers—burdening one while
    accommodating the other—when it may treat both equally
    by offering both of them the same accommodation”).18
    Again, the Court forgets that religious organizations exist
    to serve a community of believers. For-profit corporations
    do not fit that bill. Moreover, history is not on the Court’s
    side. Recognition of the discrete characters of “ecclesiasti-
    cal and lay” corporations dates back to Blackstone, see 1
    W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 458
    (1765), and was reiterated by this Court centuries before
    the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code. See Terrett

    (1961), the
    Court questions why, if “a sole proprietorship that seeks to
    make a profit may assert a free-exercise claim, [Hobby
    Lobby and Conestoga] can’t . . . do the same?” Ante, at 22
    (footnote omitted). See also ante, at 16–17. But even
    accepting, arguendo, the premise that unincorporated
    business enterprises may gain religious accommodations
    under the Free Exercise Clause, the Court’s conclusion is
    unsound. In a sole proprietorship, the business and its
    owner are one and the same. By incorporating a business,
    however, an individual separates herself from the entity
    and escapes personal responsibility for the entity’s obliga-
    tions. One might ask why the separation should hold only
    when it serves the interest of those who control the corpo-
    ration. In any event, Braunfeld is hardly impressive
    authority for the entitlement Hobby Lobby and Conestoga
    seek. The free exercise claim asserted there was promptly
    rejected on the merits.
       The Court’s determination that RFRA extends to for-
    profit corporations is bound to have untoward effects.

    closely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations
    of any size, public or private.19 Little doubt that RFRA

      19 The Court does not even begin to explain how one might go about
    ascertaining the religious scruples of a corporation where shares are
    sold to the public. No need to speculate on that, the Court says, for “it
    seems unlikely” that large corporations “will often assert RFRA
    claims.” Ante, at 29. Perhaps so, but as Hobby Lobby’s case demon-
    strates, such claims are indeed pursued by large corporations, employ-
    ing thousands of persons of different faiths, whose ownership is not
    diffuse. “Closely held” is not synonymous with “small.” Hobby Lobby is

    claims will proliferate, for the Court’s expansive notion of
    corporate personhood—combined with its other errors
    in construing RFRA—invites for-profit entities to seek
    religion-based exemptions from regulations they deem
    offensive to their faith.

       Even if Hobby Lobby and Conestoga were deemed RFRA
    “person[s],” to gain an exemption, they must demonstrate
    that the contraceptive coverage requirement “substan-

    §2000bb–1(a). Congress no doubt meant the modifier
    “substantially” to carry weight. In the original draft of
    RFRA, the word “burden” appeared unmodified. The word
    “substantially” was inserted pursuant to a clarifying
    amendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Hatch. See

    hardly the only enterprise of sizable scale that is family owned or
    closely held. For example, the family-owned candy giant Mars, Inc.,
    takes in $33 billion in revenues and has some 72,000 employees, and
    closely held Cargill, Inc., takes in more than $136 billion in reve-
    nues and employs some 140,000 persons. See Forbes, America’s Larg-

       Nor does the Court offer any instruction on how to resolve the dis-
    putes that may crop up among corporate owners over religious values
    and accommodations. The Court is satisfied that “[s]tate corporate law
    provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts,” ante, at 30, but the
    authorities cited in support of that proposition are hardly helpful. See
    Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, §351 (2011) (certificates of incorporation may
    specify how the business is managed); 1 J. Cox & T. Hazen, Treatise on

id., §14:11 (observing

    
    
    that “[d]espite the
    frequency of dissension and deadlock in close corporations, in some
    states neither legislatures nor courts have provided satisfactory solu-
    tions”). And even if a dispute settlement mechanism is in place, how is
    the arbiter of a religion-based intracorporate controversy to resolve the
    disagreement, given this Court’s instruction that “courts have no
    business addressing [whether an asserted religious belief] is substan-
    tial,” ante, at 36?

Ibid. The Court barely

    
    
    pauses to inquire whether any burden
    imposed by the contraceptive coverage requirement is

    embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for
    them to provide the coverage.” Ante, at 36.20 I agree with

    convictions regarding contraception are sincerely held.

       20 The Court dismisses the argument, advanced by some amici, that
    
    the $2,000-per-employee tax charged to certain employers that fail to
    provide health insurance is less than the average cost of offering health
    insurance, noting that the Government has not provided the statistics
    that could support such an argument. See ante, at 32–34. The Court
    overlooks, however, that it is not the Government’s obligation to prove
    that an asserted burden is insubstantial. Instead, it is incumbent upon
    plaintiffs to demonstrate, in support of a RFRA claim, the substantial-
    ity of the alleged burden.
       21 The Court levels a criticism that is as wrongheaded as can be. In
    
    no way does the dissent “tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.”
    Ante, at 37. Right or wrong in this domain is a judgment no Member of
    this Court, or any civil court, is authorized or equipped to make. What
    the Court must decide is not “the plausibility of a religious claim,” ante,

       That distinction is a facet of the pre-Smith jurispru-

[476 U.S. 693 ](/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/)

    
    
    (1986), is instructive. There, the Court rejected a free
    exercise challenge to the Government’s use of a Native
    American child’s Social Security number for purposes of
    administering benefit programs. Without questioning the
    sincerity of the father’s religious belief that “use of [his
    daughter’s Social Security] number may harm [her] spirit,”
    the Court concluded that the Government’s internal
    uses of that number “place[d] [no] restriction on what [the
    father] may believe or what he may do.” 

[Id., at 699. ](/opinion/111688/bowen-v-roy/)

    
    
    Recognizing that the father’s “religious views may not
    accept” the position that the challenged uses concerned
    only the Government’s internal affairs, the Court ex-
    plained that “for the adjudication of a constitutional claim,
    the Constitution, rather than an individual’s religion,
    must supply the frame of reference.”

    quirement carries no command that Hobby Lobby or Con-
    estoga purchase or provide the contraceptives they find
    objectionable. Instead, it calls on the companies covered
    by the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated
    funds that finance a wide variety of benefits under com-
    prehensive health plans. Those plans, in order to comply
    with the ACA, 

see supra, at 3

    
    
    –6, must offer contraceptive
    coverage without cost sharing, just as they must cover an
    array of other preventive services.
      Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits
    under the plans are made not by Hobby Lobby or Cones-
    toga, but by the covered employees and dependents, in
    consultation with their health care providers. Should an
    employee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious
    beliefs of the Greens and Hahns, she is of course under no
    compulsion to use the contraceptives in question. But
    “[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physi-
    cian—be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or have
    a hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense [her employ-
    er’s] decision or action.” Grote v. Sebelius, 

708 F.3d 850

    
    
    ,
    865 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J., dissenting). It is doubtful that
    Congress, when it specified that burdens must be “sub-
    stantia[l],” had in mind a linkage thus interrupted by
    independent decisionmakers (the woman and her health
    counselor) standing between the challenged government
    action and the religious exercise claimed to be infringed.
    Any decision to use contraceptives made by a woman
    covered under Hobby Lobby’s or Conestoga’s plan will not
    be propelled by the Government, it will be the wo-
    man’s autonomous choice, informed by the physician she
    consults.
                              3
      Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and
    Conestoga meet the substantial burden requirement, the
    Government has shown that the contraceptive coverage

    for which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests
    in public health and women’s well being. Those interests
    are concrete, specific, and demonstrated by a wealth of
    empirical evidence. To recapitulate, the mandated contra-
    ception coverage enables women to avoid the health prob-
    lems unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their
    children. See IOM Report 102–107. The coverage helps
    safeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may
    be hazardous, even life threatening. See Brief for Ameri-
    can College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et al. as
    Amici Curiae 14–15. And the mandate secures benefits
    wholly unrelated to pregnancy, preventing certain cancers,
    menstrual disorders, and pelvic pain. Brief for Ovarian
    Cancer National Alliance et al. as Amici Curiae 4, 6–7, 15–
    16; 78 Fed. Reg. 39872 (2013); IOM Report 107.
       That Hobby Lobby and Conestoga resist coverage for
    only 4 of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives does not
    lessen these compelling interests. Notably, the corpora-
    tions exclude intrauterine devices (IUDs), devices signifi-
    cantly more effective, and significantly more expensive
    than other contraceptive methods. See 

id., at 105.22

    
    
    Moreover, the Court’s reasoning appears to permit com-
    mercial enterprises like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to
    exclude from their group health plans all forms of contra-
    ceptives. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38–39 (counsel for Hobby
    Lobby acknowledged that his “argument . . . would apply
    just as well if the employer said ‘no contraceptives’ ” (in-
    ternal quotation marks added)).

       Federal statutes often include exemptions for small
    employers, and such provisions have never been held to
    undermine the interests served by these statutes. See,

       The ACA’s grandfathering provision,

    allows a phasing-in period for compliance with a number
    of the Act’s requirements (not just the contraceptive cov-
    erage or other preventive services provisions). Once speci-
    fied changes are made, grandfathered status ceases. See
    45 CFR §147.140(g). Hobby Lobby’s own situation is
    illustrative. By the time this litigation commenced, Hobby
    Lobby did not have grandfathered status. Asked why by
    the District Court, Hobby Lobby’s counsel explained that
    the “grandfathering requirements mean that you can’t
    make a whole menu of changes to your plan that involve
    things like the amount of co-pays, the amount of co-
    insurance, deductibles, that sort of thing.” App. in No. 13–
    354, pp. 39–40. Counsel acknowledged that, “just because
    of economic realities, our plan has to shift over time. I
    mean, insurance plans, as everyone knows, shif[t] over

       The Court ultimately acknowledges a critical point:
    RFRA’s application “must take adequate account of the
    burdens a requested accommodation may impose on non-
    beneficiaries.” Ante, at 42, n. 37 (quoting Cutter v. Wil­
    kinson, 

[544 U.S. 709](/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/)

    
    
    , 720 (2005); emphasis added). No
    tradition, and no prior decision under RFRA, allows a
    religion-based exemption when the accommodation would
    be harmful to others—here, the very persons the contra-
    ceptive coverage requirement was designed to protect.

      After assuming the existence of compelling government
    interests, the Court holds that the contraceptive coverage
    requirement fails to satisfy RFRA’s least restrictive means
    test. But the Government has shown that there is no less

    insurance coverage for certain contraceptives (which they
    believe cause abortions); and (2) carry out the objective of
    the ACA’s contraceptive coverage requirement, to ensure
    that women employees receive, at no cost to them, the
    preventive care needed to safeguard their health and well
    being. A “least restrictive means” cannot require employ-
    ees to relinquish benefits accorded them by federal law in
    order to ensure that their commercial employers can
    adhere unreservedly to their religious tenets. 

See supra, at 7

    
    
    –8, 27.25
      Then let the government pay (rather than the employees
    who do not share their employer’s faith), the Court sug-
    gests. “The most straightforward [alternative],” the Court
    asserts, “would be for the Government to assume the cost
    of providing . . . contraceptives . . . to any women who are
    unable to obtain them under their health-insurance poli-
    cies due to their employers’ religious objections.” Ante, at
    41. The ACA, however, requires coverage of preventive
    services through the existing employer-based system of
    health insurance “so that [employees] face minimal logisti-
    cal and administrative obstacles.” 78 Fed. Reg. 39888.
    Impeding women’s receipt of benefits “by requiring them
    to take steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new
    [government funded and administered] health benefit”
    was scarcely what Congress contemplated.

      And where is the stopping point to the “let the govern-

    , 1392 (CA4 1990)? Does it rank as
    a less restrictive alternative to require the government to
    provide the money or benefit to which the employer has
    a religion-based objection?26 Because the Court cannot
    easily answer that question, it proposes something else:
    Extension to commercial enterprises of the accommodation
    already afforded to nonprofit religion-based organizations.
    See ante, at 3–4, 9–10, 43–45. “At a minimum,” according
    to the Court, such an approach would not “impinge on
    [Hobby Lobby’s and Conestoga’s] religious belief.” Ante, at

    tions. “We do not decide today whether [the] approach

    ment whether the Court-proposed alternative was ac-
    ceptable,27 counsel responded: “We haven’t been offered
    that accommodation, so we haven’t had to decide what
    kind of objection, if any, we would make to that.” Tr. of
    Oral Arg. 86–87.
       Conestoga suggests that, if its employees had to acquire
    and pay for the contraceptives (to which the corporation
    objects) on their own, a tax credit would qualify as a less
    restrictive alternative. See Brief for Petitioners in No. 13–
    356, p. 64. A tax credit, of course, is one variety of “let the
    government pay.” In addition to departing from the exist-
    ing employer-based system of health insurance, Conesto-
    ga’s alternative would require a woman to reach into her
    own pocket in the first instance, and it would do nothing
    for the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.
       In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish,
    ——————
      27 On brief, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga barely addressed the exten-
    sion solution, which would bracket commercial enterprises with non-
    profit religion-based organizations for religious accommodations pur-
    poses. The hesitation is understandable, for challenges to the adequacy
    of the accommodation accorded religious nonprofit organizations are
    currently sub judice. See, e.g., Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the
    Aged v. Sebelius, ___ F. Supp. 2d ___,

    to [that] novel claim.” Ante, at 33. Yet the Court is content to decide
    this case (and this case only) on the ground that HHS could make an

[455 U.S. 252 ](/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/)

    
    
    (1982).
    Lee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry,
    was a member of the Old Order Amish. He sincerely
    believed that withholding Social Security taxes from his
    employees or paying the employer’s share of such taxes
    would violate the Amish faith. This Court held that,
    although the obligations imposed by the Social Security
    system conflicted with Lee’s religious beliefs, the burden
    was not unconstitutional.

    (recognizing the important governmental interest in
    providing a “nationwide . . . comprehensive insurance
    system with a variety of benefits available to all partici-
    pants, with costs shared by employers and employees”).28
    The Government urges that Lee should control the chal-
    lenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. See Brief
    for Respondents in No. 13–356, p. 18. In contrast, today’s
    Court dismisses Lee as a tax case. See ante, at 46–47.
    Indeed, it was a tax case and the Court in Lee homed in on
    “[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate religious
    beliefs in the area of 

taxation.” [455 U.S., at 259](/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/)

    
    
    .
       But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot
    confine to tax cases. “When followers of a particular sect
    enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,” the
    Court observed, “the limits they accept on their own con-
    duct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be

      28 Asa sole proprietor, Lee was subject to personal liability for violat-

    business as a corporation, thus avoiding personal liability.

    superimposed on statutory schemes which are binding on
    others in that activity.” 

[Id., at 261. ](/opinion/110647/united-states-v-lee/)

    
    
    The statutory scheme
    of employer-based comprehensive health coverage in-
    volved in these cases is surely binding on others engaged
    in the same trade or business as the corporate challengers
    here, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga. Further, the Court
    recognized in Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption
    to a commercial employer would “operat[e] to impose the
    employer’s religious faith on the employees.” Ibid.29 No
    doubt the Greens and Hahns and all who share their
    beliefs may decline to acquire for themselves the contra-
    ceptives in question. But that choice may not be imposed
    on employees who hold other beliefs. Working for Hobby
    Lobby or Conestoga, in other words, should not deprive
    employees of the preventive care available to workers at
    the shop next door,30 at least in the absence of directions
    from the Legislature or Administration to do so.
       Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress
    or the regulatory authority, and not this Court? Hobby
    Lobby and Conestoga surely do not stand alone as com-
    mercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally
    applicable laws on the basis of their religious beliefs. See,

      29 Congress  amended the Social Security Act in response to Lee. The
    amended statute permits Amish sole proprietors and partnerships (but
    not Amish-owned corporations) to obtain an exemption from the obliga-
    tion to pay Social Security taxes only for employees who are co-
    religionists and who likewise seek an exemption and agree to give up
    their Social Security benefits. See 

26 U.S. C

    
    
    . §3127(a)(2), (b)(1). Thus,
    employers with sincere religious beliefs have no right to a religion-
    based exemption that would deprive employees of Social Security
    benefits without the employee’s consent—an exemption analogous to
    the one Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek here.

    Would RFRA require exemptions in cases of this ilk? And
    if not, how does the Court divine which religious beliefs
    are worthy of accommodation, and which are not? Isn’t
    the Court disarmed from making such a judgment given
    its recognition that “courts must not presume to determine
    . . . the plausibility of a religious claim”? Ante, at 37.
        Would the exemption the Court holds RFRA demands

    use of certain contraceptives extend to employers with
    religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions

    medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia,
    intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain
    Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian

    Scientists, among others)?31 According to counsel for
    Hobby Lobby, “each one of these cases . . . would have to
    be evaluated on its own . . . apply[ing] the compelling
    interest-least restrictive alternative test.” Tr. of Oral Arg.
    6. Not much help there for the lower courts bound by
    today’s decision.
       The Court, however, sees nothing to worry about. To-
    day’s cases, the Court concludes, are “concerned solely
    with the contraceptive mandate. Our decision should not
    be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate
    must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer’s
    religious beliefs. Other coverage requirements, such as
    immunizations, may be supported by different interests
    (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious
    diseases) and may involve different arguments about the
    least restrictive means of providing them.” Ante, at 46.
    But the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the
    interest in women’s health and well being is compelling
    and has come up with no means adequate to serve that
    interest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Wom-
    en’s Health Amendment.
       There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the
    courts “out of the business of evaluating the relative mer-
    its of differing religious claims,”

    religion over another,” the very “risk the Establishment

      We agree with JUSTICE GINSBURG that the plaintiffs’
    challenge to the contraceptive coverage requirement fails
    on the merits. We need not and do not decide whether
    either for-profit corporations or their owners may bring
    claims under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of
    1993. Accordingly, we join all but Part III–C–1 of JUSTICE
    GINSBURG’s dissenting opinion.
