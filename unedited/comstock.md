    CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                     THE FOURTH CIRCUIT
    
        No. 08–1224. Argued January 12, 2010—Decided May 17, 2010
    Federal law allows a district court to order the civil commitment of a
      mentally ill, sexually dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date he
      would otherwise be released. 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248. The Government in
      stituted civil-commitment proceedings under §4248 against respon
      dents, each of whom moved to dismiss on the ground, inter alia, that,
      in enacting the statute, Congress exceeded its powers under the Nec
      essary and Proper Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Agreeing,
      the District Court granted dismissal, and the Fourth Circuit affirmed
      on the legislative-power ground.
    Held: The Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress authority suf
     ficient to enact §4248. Taken together, five considerations compel
     this conclusion. Pp. 5–22.
        (1) The Clause grants Congress broad authority to pass laws in fur
     therance of its constitutionally enumerated powers. It makes clear
     that grants of specific federal legislative authority are accompanied
     by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient, or useful” or “con
     ducive” to the enumerated power’s “beneficial exercise,” e.g.,
     McCulloch v. Maryland, 

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 413, 418, and that Congress
     can “legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be
     involved in the constitution,” 

[id., at 421. ](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    In determining whether the
     Clause authorizes a particular federal statute, there must be “means
     ends rationality” between the enacted statute and the source of fed
     eral power. Sabri v. United States, 

[541 U.S. 600](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 605. The Constitu
     tion “addresse[s]” the “choice of means” “primarily . . . to the judg
     ment of Congress. If it can be seen that the means adopted are really
     calculated to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the extent
     to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of the relationship be
     tween the means adopted and the end to be attained, are matters for
    2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                                      Syllabus
    
        congressional determination alone.” Burroughs v. United States, 

[290 U.S. 534](/opinion/102172/burroughs-and-cannon-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 547–548. Thus, although the Constitution nowhere grants
        Congress express power to create federal crimes beyond those specifi
        cally enumerated, to punish their violation, to imprison violators, to
        provide appropriately for those imprisoned, or to maintain the secu
        rity of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected by the
        federal imprisonment of others, Congress possesses broad authority
        to do each of those things under the Clause. Pp. 5–9.
           (2) Congress has long been involved in the delivery of mental
        health care to federal prisoners, and has long provided for their civil
        commitment. See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1855, 10 Stat. 682; Insanity De
        fense Reform Act of 1984, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§4241–4247. A longstanding
        history of related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s con
        stitutionality, see, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 

[397 U.S. 664](/opinion/108135/walz-v-tax-commn-of-city-of-new-york/)

    
    
    , 678, but can be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a
        congressional statutory scheme,” Gonzales v. Raich, 

[545 U.S. 1](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    , 21,
        and, in particular, the reasonableness of the relation between the
        new statute and pre-existing federal interests. Section 4248 differs
        from earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons who, due
        to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous. Many of these individu
        als, however, were likely already subject to civil commitment under
        §4246, which, since 1949, has authorized the postsentence detention
        of federal prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are
        thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). The similarities
        between §4246 and §4248 demonstrate that the latter is a modest
        addition to a longstanding federal statutory framework. Pp. 9–14.
           (3) There are sound reasons for §4248’s enactment. The Federal
        Government, as custodian of its prisoners, has the constitutional
        power to act in order to protect nearby (and other) communities from
        the danger such prisoners may pose. Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably
        adapted” to Congress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian.
        United States v. Darby, 

[312 U.S. 100](/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/)

    
    
    , 121. Congress could have rea
        sonably concluded that federal inmates who suffer from a mental ill
        ness that causes them to “have serious difficulty in refraining from
        sexually violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially high
        danger to the public if released. And Congress could also have rea
        sonably concluded that a reasonable number of such individuals
        would likely not be detained by the States if released from federal
        custody. Congress’ desire to address these specific challenges, taken
        together with its responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the
        conclusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end rationality,”

    . Pp. 14–16.
           (4) Respondents’ contention that §4248 violates the Tenth Amend
        ment because it invades the province of state sovereignty in an area
                          Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                      3
    
                                     Syllabus
    
      typically left to state control is rejected. That Amendment does not
      “reserve to the States” those powers that are “delegated to the United
      States by the Constitution,” including the powers delegated by the
      Necessary and Proper Clause. See, e.g., New York v. United States,
      

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 159. And §4248 does not “invade” state sovereignty,
      but rather requires accommodation of state interests: Among other
      things, it directs the Attorney General to inform the States where the
      federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” of his detention, §4248(d),
      and gives either State the right, at any time, to assert its authority
      over the individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate
      transfer to State custody, §4248(d)(1). In Greenwood v. United
      States, 

[350 U.S. 366](/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 375–376, the Court rejected a similar challenge
      to §4248’s predecessor, the 1949 statute described above. Because
      the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less protective of
      state interests than §4248, a fortiori, the current statute does not in
      vade state interests. Pp. 16–18.
        (5) Section 4248 is narrow in scope. The Court rejects respondents’
      argument that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary and
      Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more than one step re
      moved from a specifically enumerated power. See, e.g., 

McCulloch, supra, at 417

    
    
    . Nor will the Court’s holding today confer on Congress
      a general “police power, which the Founders denied the National
      Government and reposed in the States.” United States v. Morrison,
      

[529 U.S. 598](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    , 618. Section §4248 has been applied to only a small
      fraction of federal prisoners, and its reach is limited to individuals al
      ready “in the custody of the” Federal Government, §4248(a). Thus,
      far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a reasonably adapted and
      narrowly tailored means of pursuing the Government’s legitimate in
      terest as a federal custodian in the responsible administration of its
      prison system. See New 

York, supra, at 157

    
    
    . Pp. 18–22.
        The Court does not reach or decide any claim that the statute or its
      application denies equal protection, procedural or substantive due
      process, or any other constitutional rights. Respondents are free to
      pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have preserved.

                                    [May 17, 2010]
    
    
      JUSTICE BREYER delivered the opinion of the Court.
      A federal civil-commitment statute authorizes the De
    partment of Justice to detain a mentally ill, sexually
    dangerous federal prisoner beyond the date the prisoner
    would otherwise be released. 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248. We have
    previously examined similar statutes enacted under state
    law to determine whether they violate the Due Process
    Clause. See Kansas v. Hendricks, 

[521 U.S. 346](/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/)

    
    
    , 356–358
    (1997); Kansas v. Crane, 

[534 U.S. 407 ](/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/)

    
    
    (2002). But this
    case presents a different question. Here we ask whether
    the Federal Government has the authority under Article I
    of the Constitution to enact this federal civil-commitment
    program or whether its doing so falls beyond the reach of a
    government “of enumerated powers.” McCulloch v. Mary
    land, 

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 405 (1819). We conclude that the
    Constitution grants Congress the authority to enact §4248
    as “necessary and proper for carrying into Execution” the
    powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the Government of
    the United States.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
                                I
      The federal statute before us allows a district court to
    2              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    order the civil commitment of an individual who is cur
    rently “in the custody of the [Federal] Bureau of Prisons,”
    §4248, if that individual (1) has previously “engaged or
    attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child
    molestation,” (2) currently “suffers from a serious mental
    illness, abnormality, or disorder,” and (3) “as a result of”
    that mental illness, abnormality, or disorder is “sexually
    dangerous to others,” in that “he would have serious diffi
    culty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child
    molestation if released.” §§4247(a)(5)–(6).
       In order to detain such a person, the Government (act
    ing through the Department of Justice) must certify to a
    federal district judge that the prisoner meets the condi
    tions just described, i.e., that he has engaged in sexually
    violent activity or child molestation in the past and that
    he suffers from a mental illness that makes him corre
    spondingly dangerous to others. §4248(a). When such a
    certification is filed, the statute automatically stays the
    individual’s release from prison, ibid., thereby giving the
    Government an opportunity to prove its claims at a hear
    ing through psychiatric (or other) evidence, §§4247(b)–(c),
    4248(b). The statute provides that the prisoner “shall be
    represented by counsel” and shall have “an opportunity” at
    the hearing “to testify, to present evidence, to subpoena
    witnesses on his behalf, and to confront and cross
    examine” the Government’s witnesses. §§4247(d), 4248(c).
       If the Government proves its claims by “clear and con
    vincing evidence,” the court will order the prisoner’s con
    tinued commitment in “the custody of the Attorney Gen
    eral,” who must “make all reasonable efforts to cause” the
    State where that person was tried, or the State where he
    is domiciled, to “assume responsibility for his custody,
    care, and treatment.” §4248(d); cf. Sullivan v. Freeman,
    

[944 F.2d 334](/opinion/567974/joseph-el-sullivan-v-david-r-freeman-and-james-
c-delworth/)

    
    
    , 337 (CA7 1991). If either State is willing to
    assume that responsibility, the Attorney General “shall
    release” the individual “to the appropriate official” of that
                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    State. §4248(d). But if, “notwithstanding such efforts,
    neither such State will assume such responsibility,” then
    “the Attorney General shall place the person for treatment
    in a suitable [federal] facility.” Ibid.; cf. §4247(i)(A).
       Confinement in the federal facility will last until either
    (1) the person’s mental condition improves to the point
    where he is no longer dangerous (with or without appro
    priate ongoing treatment), in which case he will be re
    leased; or (2) a State assumes responsibility for his cus
    tody, care, and treatment, in which case he will be
    transferred to the custody of that State. §§4248(d)(1)–(2).
    The statute establishes a system for ongoing psychiatric
    and judicial review of the individual’s case, including
    judicial hearings at the request of the confined person at
    six-month intervals. §§4247(e)(1)(B), (h).
       In November and December 2006, the Government
    instituted proceedings in the Federal District Court for the
    Eastern District of North Carolina against the five re
    spondents in this case. Three of the five had previously
    pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of child por
    nography, see 

[507 F. Supp. 2d 522](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/)

    
    
    , 526, and n. 2 (2007);
    §2252A(a), and the fourth had pleaded guilty to sexual
    abuse of a minor, see United States v. Vigil, No.
    1:99CR00509–001 (D NM, Jan. 26, 2000); §§1153, 2243(a).
    With respect to each of them, the Government claimed
    that the respondent was about to be released from federal
    prison, that he had engaged in sexually violent conduct or
    child molestation in the past, and that he suffered from a
    mental illness that made him sexually dangerous to oth
    ers. App. 38–40, 44–52. During that same time period,
    the Government instituted similar proceedings against the
    fifth respondent, who had been charged in federal court
    with aggravated sexual abuse of a minor, but was found
    mentally incompetent to stand trial. See 

id., at 41–43;

    2006); §4241(d).

                         Opinion of the Court
    
       Each of the five respondents moved to dismiss the civil
    commitment proceeding on constitutional grounds. They
    claimed that the commitment proceeding is, in fact, crimi
    nal, not civil, in nature and consequently that it violates
    the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Ex Post Facto Clause,
    and the Sixth and Eighth 

Amendments. [507 F. Supp. 2d, at 528](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-

    . They claimed that the statute denies them sub
    stantive due process and equal protection of the laws.
    

[Ibid.](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/) They claimed that

    
    
    it violates their procedural due
    process rights by allowing a showing of sexual dangerous
    ness to be made by clear and convincing evidence, instead
    of by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 

[Ibid.](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/) And, finally, they

    
    
    claimed that, in enacting the statute, Congress ex
    ceeded the powers granted to it by Art. I, §8 of the Consti
    tution, including those granted by the Commerce Clause
    and the Necessary and Proper 

Clause. [507 F. Supp. 2d, at 528](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/)

    
    
    –529.
       The District Court, accepting two of the respondents’
    claims, granted their motion to dismiss. It agreed with
    respondents that the Constitution requires proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt,

    statute, Congress exceeded its Article I legislative 

powers, [507 F. Supp. 2d, at 530](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/)

       The Government sought certiorari, and we granted its
    request, limited to the question of Congress’ authority
    under Art. I, §8 of the Constitution. Pet. for Cert. i. Since
    then, two other Courts of Appeals have considered that
    same question, each deciding it in the Government’s favor,
    thereby creating a split of authority among the Circuits.

                                   II
       The question presented is whether the Necessary and
    Proper Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 18, grants Congress authority
    sufficient to enact the statute before us. In resolving that
    question, we assume, but we do not decide, that other
    provisions of the Constitution—such as the Due Process
    Clause—do not prohibit civil commitment in these circum
    stances. Cf. Hendricks,

    (1979). In other words, we assume for ar
    gument’s sake that the Federal Constitution would permit
    a State to enact this statute, and we ask solely whether
    the Federal Government, exercising its enumerated pow
    ers, may enact such a statute as well. On that assump
    tion, we conclude that the Constitution grants Congress
    legislative power sufficient to enact §4248. We base this
    conclusion on five considerations, taken together.
       First, the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress
    broad authority to enact federal legislation. Nearly 200
    years ago, this Court stated that the Federal “[G]overn
    ment is acknowledged by all to be one of enumerated
    powers,” 

McCulloch, [4 Wheat., at 405](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , which means that
    “[e]very law enacted by Congress must be based on one or
    more of” those powers, United States v. Morrison, 

[529 U.S. 598](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    , 607 (2000). But, at the same time, “a govern
    ment, entrusted with such” powers “must also be en
    trusted with ample means for their execution.”
    

McCulloch, [4 Wheat., at 408](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    . Accordingly, the Necessary
    and Proper Clause makes clear that the Constitution’s
    grants of specific federal legislative authority are accom
    panied by broad power to enact laws that are “convenient,
    or useful” or “conducive” to the authority’s “beneficial
    exercise.”

    (“[Congress
    can] legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which
    must be involved in the constitution . . .”). Chief Justice

                         Opinion of the Court
    
    Marshall emphasized that the word “necessary” does not
    mean “absolutely necessary.” 

[Id., at 413–415 ](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    (emphasis
    deleted); Jinks v. Richland County, 

[538 U.S. 456](/opinion/127912/jinks-v-richland-county/)

    
    
    , 462
    (2003) (“[W]e long ago rejected the view that the Neces
    sary and Proper Clause demands that an Act of Congress
    be ‘ “absolutely necessary” ’ to the exercise of an enumer
    ated power”). In language that has come to define the
    scope of the Necessary and Proper Clause, he wrote:
        “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of
        the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
        which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
        prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
        constitution, are constitutional.” 

McCulloch, supra, at 421

    
    
    .
       We have since made clear that, in determining whether
    the Necessary and Proper Clause grants Congress the
    legislative authority to enact a particular federal statute,
    we look to see whether the statute constitutes a means
    that is rationally related to the implementation of a con
    stitutionally enumerated power. Sabri v. United States,

    ality” to describe the necessary relationship);

[545 U.S. 1](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    , 22 (2005) (holding that
    because “Congress had a rational basis” for concluding
    that a statute implements Commerce Clause power, the
    statute falls within the scope of congressional “authority to
    ‘make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper’ to
    ‘regulate Commerce . . . among the several States’ ” (ellip
    sis in original)); see also United States v. Lopez,

       Of course, as Chief Justice Marshall stated, a federal

    statute, in addition to being authorized by Art. I, §8, must
    also “not [be] prohibited” by the Constitution. 

McCulloch, supra, at 421

    
    
    . But as we have already stated, the present
    statute’s validity under provisions of the Constitution
    other than the Necessary and Proper Clause is an issue
    that is not before us. Under the question presented, the
    relevant inquiry is simply “whether the means chosen are
    ‘reasonably adapted’ to the attainment of a legitimate end
    under the commerce power” or under other powers that
    the Constitution grants Congress the authority to imple
    ment.

    121 (1941)).
       We have also recognized that the Constitution “ad
    dresse[s]” the “choice of means”
        “primarily . . . to the judgment of Congress. If it can
        be seen that the means adopted are really calculated
        to attain the end, the degree of their necessity, the ex
        tent to which they conduce to the end, the closeness of
        the relationship between the means adopted and the
        end to be attained, are matters for congressional de
        termination alone.” Burroughs v. United States,

       Thus, the Constitution, which nowhere speaks explicitly
    about the creation of federal crimes beyond those related
    to “counterfeiting,” “treason,” or “Piracies and Felonies
    committed on the high Seas” or “against the Law of Na
    tions,” Art. I, §8, cls. 6, 10; Art. III, §3, nonetheless grants
    Congress broad authority to create such crimes. See

    (1878). And Congress routinely exercises its authority to
    enact criminal laws in furtherance of, for example, its
    enumerated powers to regulate interstate and foreign
    commerce, to enforce civil rights, to spend funds for the
    general welfare, to establish federal courts, to establish
    post offices, to regulate bankruptcy, to regulate naturali

    crimes); 

8 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§1324–1328 (immigration crimes).
       Similarly, Congress, in order to help ensure the en
    forcement of federal criminal laws enacted in furtherance
    of its enumerated powers, “can cause a prison to be erected
    at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States,
    and direct that all persons sentenced to imprisonment
    under the laws of the United States shall be confined
    there.” Ex parte Karstendick, 

[93 U.S. 396](/opinion/89393/ex-parte-karstendick/)

    
    
    , 400 (1876).
    Moreover, Congress, having established a prison system,
    can enact laws that seek to ensure that system’s safe and
    responsible administration by, for example, requiring
                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            9
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    prisoners to receive medical care and educational training,
    see, e.g., 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§4005–4006; §4042(a)(3), and can
    also ensure the safety of the prisoners, prison workers and
    visitors, and those in surrounding communities by, for
    example, creating further criminal laws governing entry,
    exit, and smuggling, and by employing prison guards to
    ensure discipline and security. See, e.g., §1791 (prohibit
    ing smuggling contraband); §751 et seq. (prohibiting es
    cape and abetting thereof); 28 CFR §541.10 et seq. (2009)
    (inmate discipline).
       Neither Congress’ power to criminalize conduct, nor its
    power to imprison individuals who engage in that conduct,
    nor its power to enact laws governing prisons and prison
    ers, is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. But Con
    gress nonetheless possesses broad authority to do each of
    those things in the course of “carrying into Execution” the
    enumerated powers “vested by” the “Constitution in the
    Government of the United States,” Art. I, §8, cl. 18—
    authority granted by the Necessary and Proper Clause.
       Second, the civil-commitment statute before us consti
    tutes a modest addition to a set of federal prison-related
    mental-health statutes that have existed for many dec
    ades. We recognize that even a longstanding history of
    related federal action does not demonstrate a statute’s
    constitutionality. See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of
    New York, 

[397 U.S. 664](/opinion/108135/walz-v-tax-commn-of-city-of-new-york/)

    
    
    , 678 (1970) (“[N]o one acquires a
    vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by
    long use . . .”); cf. 

Morrison, [529 U.S., at 612](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    –614 (legisla
    tive history is neither necessary nor sufficient with respect
    to Art. I analysis). A history of involvement, however, can
    nonetheless be “helpful in reviewing the substance of a
    congressional statutory scheme,” 

Gonzales, [545 U.S., at 21](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    ; 

[Walz, supra, at 678](/opinion/108135/walz-v-tax-commn-of-city-of-new-york/)

    
    
    , and, in particular, the reason
    ableness of the relation between the new statute and pre
    existing federal interests.
       Here, Congress has long been involved in the delivery of
    10              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    mental health care to federal prisoners, and has long
    provided for their civil commitment. In 1855 it estab
    lished Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in the District of Colum
    bia to provide treatment to “the insane of the army and
    navy . . . and of the District of Columbia.” Act of Mar. 3,
    1855, 10 Stat. 682; 39 Stat. 309. In 1857 it provided for
    confinement at Saint Elizabeth’s of any person within the
    District of Columbia who had been “charged with [a]
    crime” and who was “insane” or later became “insane
    during the continuance of his or her sentence in the
    United States penitentiary.” Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11
    Stat. 158; see 17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881). In
    1874, expanding the geographic scope of its statutes,
    Congress provided for civil commitment in federal facili
    ties (or in state facilities if a State so agreed) of “all per
    sons who have been or shall be convicted of any offense in
    any court of the United States” and who are or “shall
    become” insane “during the term of their imprisonment.”
    Act of June 23, 1874, ch. 465, 18 Stat. 251 (emphasis
    added). And in 1882 Congress provided for similar com
    mitment of those “charged” with federal offenses who
    become “insane” while in the “custody” of the United
    States. Act of Aug. 7, 1882, 22 Stat. 330 (emphasis
    added). Thus, over the span of three decades, Congress
    created a national, federal civil-commitment program
    under which any person who was either charged with or
    convicted of any federal offense in any federal court could
    be confined in a federal mental institution.
       These statutes did not raise the question presented
    here, for they all provided that commitment in a federal
    hospital would end upon the completion of the relevant
    “terms” of federal “imprisonment” as set forth in the un
    derlying criminal sentence or statute. §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252;
    see 35 Op. Atty. Gen. 366, 368 (1927); cf. 30 Op. Atty. Gen.
    569, 571 (1916). But in the mid-1940’s that proviso was
    eliminated.

                         Opinion of the Court
    
      In 1945 the Judicial Conference of the United States
    proposed legislative reforms of the federal civil
    commitment system. The Judicial Conference based its
    proposals upon what this Court has described as a “long
    study by a conspicuously able committee” (chaired by
    Judge Calvert Magruder and whose members included
    Judge Learned Hand), involving consultation “with federal
    district and circuit judges” across the country as well as
    with the Department of Justice. Greenwood v. United
    States, 

[350 U.S. 366](/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 373 (1956); Greenwood v. United
    States, 

[219 F.2d 376](/opinion/235793/earl-p-greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 380–384 (CA8 1955) (describing the
    committee’s work). The committee studied, among other
    things, the “serious problem faced by the Bureau of Pris
    ons, namely, what to do with insane criminals upon the
    expiration of their terms of confinement, where it would be
    dangerous to turn them loose upon society and where no
    state will assume responsibility for their custody.” Judi
    cial Conference, Report of Committee to Study Treatment
    Accorded by Federal Courts to Insane Persons Charged
    with Crime 11 (1945) (hereinafter Committee Report),
    App. 73. The committee provided examples of instances in
    which the Bureau of Prisons had struggled with the prob
    lem of “ ‘paranoid’ ” and “ ‘threatening’ ” individuals whom
    no State would accept. 

[Id., at 9, ](/opinion/235793/earl-p-greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    App. 71. And it noted
    that, in the Bureau’s “[e]xperience,” States would not
    accept an “appreciable number” of “mental[ly] incompe
    tent” individuals “nearing expiration” of their prison
    terms, because of their “lack of legal residence in any
    State,” even though those individuals “ought not . . . be at
    large because they constitute a menace to public safety.”
    H. R. Rep. No. 1319, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1949) (state
    ment of James V. Bennett, Director); see also Letter from
    Bennett to Judge Magruder, attachment to Committee
    Report, App. 83–88. The committee, hence the Judicial
    Conference, therefore recommended that Congress enact
    “some provision of law authorizing the continued confine
    12               UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                           Opinion of the Court
    
    ment of such persons after their sentences expired.”
    Committee Report 11, App. 73; see also Report of the
    Judicial Conference of Senior Circuit Judges 13 (1945).
      Between 1948 and 1949, following its receipt of the
    Judicial Conference report, Congress modified the law.
    See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 855, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§4241–
    4243 (1952 ed.); Act of Sept. 7, 1949, 63 Stat. 686, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§4244–4248. It provided for the civil commit
    ment of individuals who are, or who become, mentally
    incompetent at any time after their arrest and before the
    expiration of their federal sentence, §§4241, 4244, 4247–
    4248; and it set forth various procedural safeguards,
    §§4242, 4246, 4247. With respect to an individual whose
    prison term is about to expire, it specified the following:
            “Whenever the Director of the Bureau of Prisons
         shall certify that a prisoner whose sentence is about to
         expire has been examined [and] . . . in the judgment of
         the Director and the board of examiners the prisoner
         is insane or mentally incompetent, and . . . if released
         he will probably endanger the safety of the officers,
         the property, or other interests of the United States,
         and that suitable arrangements for the custody and
         care of the prisoner are not otherwise available, the
         Attorney General shall transmit the certificate to . . .
         the court for the district in which the prisoner is con
         fined. Whereupon the court shall cause the prisoner
         to be examined . . . and shall . . . hold a hearing . . . . If
         upon such hearing the court shall determine that the
         conditions specified above exist, the court may commit
         the prisoner to the custody of the Attorney General or
         his authorized representative.” §4247.
    The precondition that the mentally ill individual’s release
    would “probably endanger the safety of the officers, the
    property, or other interests of the United States” was
    uniformly interpreted by the Judiciary to mean that his
                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)           13
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    “release would endanger the safety of persons, property or
    the public interest in general—not merely the interests
    peculiar to the United States as such.” United States v.
    Curry, 

[410 F.2d 1372](/opinion/284874/united-states-v-claude-raymond-curry/)

    , 851–852 (CA10 1960).
      In 1984, Congress modified these basic statutes. See
    Insanity Defense Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 2057, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §§4241–4247 (2006 ed.). As relevant here, it
    altered the provision just discussed, regarding the pris
    oner’s danger to the “interests of the United States,” to
    conform more closely to the then-existing judicial interpre
    tation of that language, i.e., it altered the language so as
    to authorize (explicitly) civil commitment if, in addition to
    the other conditions, the prisoner’s “release would create a
    substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or
    serious damage to the property of another.” §4246(d).
      Congress also elaborated upon the required condition
    “that suitable arrangements . . . are not otherwise avail
    able” by directing the Attorney General to seek alternative
    placement in state facilities, as we have set forth above.
    See 

ibid.; supra, at 2

    
    
    –3. With these modifications, the
    statutes continue to authorize the civil commitment of
    individuals who are both mentally ill and dangerous, once
    they have been charged with, or convicted of, a federal
    crime. §§4241(d), 4246; see also §4243(d). They continue
    to provide for the continued civil commitment of those
    individuals when they are “due for release” from federal
    custody because their “sentence is about to expire.” §4246.
    And, as we have previously set forth, they establish vari
    ous procedural and other requirements. E.g., §4247.
      In 2006, Congress enacted the particular statute before
    us. §302, 120 Stat. 619, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248. It differs from
    earlier statutes in that it focuses directly upon persons
    who, due to a mental illness, are sexually dangerous.
    Notably, many of these individuals were likely already
    subject to civil commitment under §4246, which, since
    14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    1949, has authorized the postsentence detention of federal
    prisoners who suffer from a mental illness and who are
    thereby dangerous (whether sexually or otherwise). But
    cf. H. R. Rep. No. 109–218, pt. 1, p. 29 (2005). Aside from
    its specific focus on sexually dangerous persons, §4248 is
    similar to the provisions first enacted in 1949. Cf. §4246.
    In that respect, it is a modest addition to a longstanding
    federal statutory framework, which has been in place
    since 1855.
       Third, Congress reasonably extended its longstanding
    civil-commitment system to cover mentally ill and sexually
    dangerous persons who are already in federal custody,
    even if doing so detains them beyond the termination of
    their criminal sentence. For one thing, the Federal Gov
    ernment is the custodian of its prisoners. As federal cus
    todian, it has the constitutional power to act in order to
    protect nearby (and other) communities from the danger
    federal prisoners may pose. Cf. Youngberg v. Romeo, 

[457 U.S. 307](/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/)

    
    
    , 320 (1982) (“In operating an institution such as
    [a prison system], there are occasions in which it is neces
    sary for the State to restrain the movement of residents—
    for example, to protect them as well as others from vio
    lence” (emphasis added)). Indeed, at common law, one
    “who takes charge of a third person” is “under a duty to
    exercise reasonable care to control” that person to prevent
    him from causing reasonably foreseeable “bodily harm to
    others.”    Restatement (Second) of Torts §319, p. 129

    ger likely to ensue from the release of mentally ill and
    dangerous detainees”). If a federal prisoner is infected
    with a communicable disease that threatens others, surely
    it would be “necessary and proper” for the Federal Gov
    ernment to take action, pursuant to its role as federal
    custodian, to refuse (at least until the threat diminishes)

    to release that individual among the general public, where
    he might infect others (even if not threatening an inter
    state epidemic, cf. Art. I, §8, cl. 3). And if confinement of
    such an individual is a “necessary and proper” thing to do,
    then how could it not be similarly “necessary and proper”
    to confine an individual whose mental illness threatens
    others to the same degree?
       Moreover, §4248 is “reasonably adapted,” 

Darby, [312 U.S., at 121](/opinion/103442/united-states-v-darby/)

    
    
    , to Congress’ power to act as a responsible
    federal custodian (a power that rests, in turn, upon federal
    criminal statutes that legitimately seek to implement
    constitutionally enumerated authority, 

see supra, at 7

    
    
    –8).
    Congress could have reasonably concluded that federal
    inmates who suffer from a mental illness that causes them
    to “have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually
    violent conduct,” §4247(a)(6), would pose an especially
    high danger to the public if released. Cf. H. R. Rep. No.
    109–218, at 22–23. And Congress could also have rea
    sonably concluded (as detailed in the Judicial Conference’s
    report) that a reasonable number of such individuals
    would likely not be detained by the States if released from
    federal custody, in part because the Federal Government
    itself severed their claim to “legal residence in any State”
    by incarcerating them in remote federal prisons. H. R.
    Rep. No. 1319, at 2; Committee Report 7–11, App. 69–75;
    cf. post, at 6 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Here
    Congress’ desire to address the specific challenges identi
    fied in the Reports cited above, taken together with its
    responsibilities as a federal custodian, supports the con
    clusion that §4248 satisfies “review for means-end ration
    ality,” i.e., that it satisfies the Constitution’s insistence
    that a federal statute represent a rational means for im
    plementing a constitutional grant of legislative authority.

    with the States.” Post, at 7 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). To
    the contrary, it requires accommodation of state interests:
    The Attorney General must inform the State in which the
    federal prisoner “is domiciled or was tried” that he is
    detaining someone with respect to whom those States may
    wish to assert their authority, and he must encourage
    those States to assume custody of the individual.
    §4248(d). He must also immediately “release” that person
    “to the appropriate official of” either State “if such State
    will assume [such] responsibility.” 

Ibid. And either State

    
    
    has the right, at any time, to assert its authority over the
    individual, which will prompt the individual’s immediate
    transfer to State custody. §4248(d)(1). Respondents con
    tend that the States are nonetheless “powerless to prevent
    the detention of their citizens under §4248, even if deten
    tion is contrary to the States’ policy choices.” Brief for
    Respondents 11 (emphasis added). But that is not the
    most natural reading of the statute, see §§4248(d)(1)–(e),
    and the Solicitor General acknowledges that “the Federal
    Government would have no appropriate role” with respect
    to an individual covered by the statute once “the transfer
    to State responsibility and State control has occurred.” Tr.

       In Greenwood,

    , the Court rejected a chal
    lenge to the current statute’s predecessor—i.e., to the 1949
    statute we described 

above, supra, at 11

    
    
    –12. The petition
    ers in that case claimed, like the respondents here, that
    the statute improperly interfered with state sovereignty.
    See Brief for Petitioner in Greenwood v. United States,
    O. T. 1955, No. 460, pp. 2, 18–29. But the Court rejected
    that argument. See 

Greenwood, supra, at 375

    
    
    –376. And
    the version of the statute at issue in Greenwood was less
    protective of state interests than the current statute. That
    statute authorized federal custody so long as “suitable
    arrangements” were “not otherwise available” in a State or
    otherwise. 63 Stat. 687 (emphasis added). Cf. Brief for
    18              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    Petitioner in 

Greenwood, supra, at 25

    
    
    (“What has really
    happened is that the Federal government has been dissat
    isfied with the care given by the states to those mentally
    incompetent who have been released by the Federal au
    thorities”). Here, by contrast, as we have explained, §4248
    requires the Attorney General to encourage the relevant
    States to take custody of the individual without inquiring
    into the “suitability” of their intended care or treatment,
    and to relinquish federal authority whenever a State
    asserts its own. §4248(d). Thus, if the statute at issue in
    Greenwood did not invade state interests, then, a fortiori,
    neither does §4248.
       Fifth, the links between §4248 and an enumerated
    Article I power are not too attenuated. Neither is the
    statutory provision too sweeping in its scope. Invoking the
    cautionary instruction that we may not “pile inference
    upon inference” in order to sustain congressional action
    under Article I, 

Lopez, [514 U.S., at 567](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    , respondents
    argue that, when legislating pursuant to the Necessary
    and Proper Clause, Congress’ authority can be no more
    than one step removed from a specifically enumerated
    power. See Brief for Respondents 21–22; Tr. of Oral Arg.
    27–28. But this argument is irreconcilable with our prece
    dents. Again, take Greenwood as an example. In that
    case we upheld the (likely indefinite) civil commitment of
    a mentally incompetent federal defendant who was ac
    cused of robbing a United States Post 

Office. [350 U.S., at 369](/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 375. The underlying enumerated Article I power was
    the power to “Establish Post Offices and Post Roads.”
    Art. I, §8, cl. 7. But, as Chief Justice Marshall recognized
    in McCulloch,
         “the power ‘to establish post offices and post roads’
         . . . is executed by the single act of making the estab
         lishment. . . . [F]rom this has been inferred the power
         and duty of carrying the mail along the post road,
                     Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)          19
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
        from one post office to another.          And, from
        this implied power, has again been inferred the right
        to punish those who steal letters from the post office,
        or rob the 

mail.” [4 Wheat., at 417 ](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    (emphasis added).
    And, as we have explained, from the implied power to
    punish we have further inferred both the power to im
    prison, 

see supra, at 8

    
    
    –9, and, in Greenwood, the federal
    civil-commitment power.
       Our necessary and proper jurisprudence contains multi
    ple examples of similar reasoning. For example, in Sabri
    we observed that “Congress has authority under the
    Spending Clause to appropriate federal moneys” and that
    it therefore “has corresponding authority under the Neces
    sary and Proper Clause to see to it that taxpayer dollars”
    are not “siphoned off” by “corrupt public 

officers.” [541 U.S., at 605 ](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    (citation omitted). We then further held that,
    in aid of that implied power to criminalize graft of “tax
    payer dollars,” Congress has the additional prophylactic
    power to criminalize bribes or kickbacks even when the
    stolen funds have not been “traceably skimmed from
    specific federal payments.” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/) Similarly, in United

    
    
    States v. Hall, 

[98 U.S. 343 ](/opinion/89875/united-states-v-hall/)

    
    
    (1879), we held that the Neces
    sary and Proper Clause grants Congress the power, in
    furtherance of Art. I, §8, cls. 11–13, to award “pensions to
    the wounded and disabled” soldiers of the armed forces
    and their 

dependents, [98 U.S. at 351](/opinion/89875/united-states-v-hall/)

    
    
    ; and from that im
    plied power we further inferred the “[i]mplied power” “to
    pass laws to . . . punish” anyone who fraudulently appro
    priated such pensions,

[11 Wall. 493](/opinion/88343/stewart-v-kahn/)

    
    
    , 506–507 (1871).
       Indeed even the dissent acknowledges that Congress
    has the implied power to criminalize any conduct that
    might interfere with the exercise of an enumerated power,
    and also the additional power to imprison people who
    violate those (inferentially authorized) laws, and the
    20              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    additional power to provide for the safe and reasonable
    management of those prisons, and the additional power to
    regulate the prisoners’ behavior even after their release.
    See post, at 12–13, 17, n. 11. Of course, each of those
    powers, like the powers addressed in Sabri, Hall, and
    McCulloch, is ultimately “derived from” an enumerated
    power, 

[Hall, supra, at 345](/opinion/89875/united-states-v-hall/)

    
    
    . And, as the dissent agrees,
    that enumerated power is “the enumerated power that
    justifies the defendant’s statute of conviction,” post, at 17,
    n. 11. Neither we nor the dissent can point to a single
    specific enumerated power “that justifies a criminal de
    fendant’s arrest or conviction,” post, at 12, in all cases
    because Congress relies on different enumerated powers
    (often, but not exclusively, its Commerce Clause power) to
    enact its various federal criminal statutes, 

see supra, at 7

    
    
    –
    8. But every such statute must itself be legitimately
    predicated on an enumerated power. And the same enu
    merated power that justifies the creation of a federal
    criminal statute, and that justifies the additional implied
    federal powers that the dissent considers legitimate, justi
    fies civil commitment under §4248 as well. 

See supra, at 14

    
    
    –16. Thus, we must reject respondents’ argument that
    the Necessary and Proper Clause permits no more than a
    single step between an enumerated power and an Act of
    Congress.
       Nor need we fear that our holding today confers on
    Congress a general “police power, which the Founders
    denied the National Government and reposed in the
    States.” 

Morrison, [529 U.S., at 618](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    . As the Solicitor
    General repeatedly confirmed at oral argument, §4248 is
    narrow in scope. It has been applied to only a small frac
    tion of federal prisoners. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 24–25 (105
    individuals have been subject to §4248 out of over 188,000
    federal inmates); see also Dept. of Justice, Bureau of
    Justice Statistics, W. Sabol, H. West, & M. Cooper, Pris
    oners in 2008, p. 8 (rev. Apr. 2010) (Table 8), online at

    http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/p08.pdf/ (as visited
    May 4, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court’s case file).
    And its reach is limited to individuals already “in the
    custody of the” Federal Government. §4248(a); Tr. of Oral
    Arg. 7 (“[Federal authority for §4248] has always de
    pended on the fact of Federal custody, on the fact that this
    person has entered the criminal justice system . . .”).
    Indeed, the Solicitor General argues that “the Federal
    Government would not have . . . the power to commit a
    person who . . . has been released from prison and whose
    period of supervised release is also completed.” 

Id., at 9.

    
    
    Thus, far from a “general police power,” §4248 is a rea
    sonably adapted and narrowly tailored means of pursuing
    the Government’s legitimate interest as a federal custo
    dian in the responsible administration of its prison
    system.
      To be sure, as we have previously acknowledged,
        “The Federal Government undertakes activities today
        that would have been unimaginable to the Framers in
        two senses; first, because the Framers would not have
        conceived that any government would conduct such
        activities; and second, because the Framers would not
        have believed that the Federal Government, rather
        than the States, would assume such responsibilities.
        Yet the powers conferred upon the Federal Govern
        ment by the Constitution were phrased in language
        broad enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal
        Government’s role.” New 

York, [505 U.S., at 157](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

    
    
    .
    The Framers demonstrated considerable foresight in
    drafting a Constitution capable of such resilience through
    time. As Chief Justice Marshall observed nearly 200 years
    ago, the Necessary and Proper Clause is part of “a consti
    tution intended to endure for ages to come, and, conse
    quently, to be adapted to the various crises of human
    affairs.”

                             *    *     *
       We take these five considerations together. They in
    clude: (1) the breadth of the Necessary and Proper Clause,
    (2) the long history of federal involvement in this arena,
    (3) the sound reasons for the statute’s enactment in light
    of the Government’s custodial interest in safeguarding the
    public from dangers posed by those in federal custody, (4)
    the statute’s accommodation of state interests, and (5) the
    statute’s narrow scope. Taken together, these considera
    tions lead us to conclude that the statute is a “necessary
    and proper” means of exercising the federal authority that
    permits Congress to create federal criminal laws, to pun
    ish their violation, to imprison violators, to provide appro
    priately for those imprisoned, and to maintain the security
    of those who are not imprisoned but who may be affected
    by the federal imprisonment of others. The Constitution
    consequently authorizes Congress to enact the statute.
       We do not reach or decide any claim that the statute or
    its application denies equal protection of the laws, proce
    dural or substantive due process, or any other rights
    guaranteed by the Constitution. Respondents are free to
    pursue those claims on remand, and any others they have
    preserved.
       The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
    Circuit with respect to Congress’ power to enact this stat
    ute is reversed, and the case is remanded for further
    proceedings consistent with this opinion.
                                                  It is so ordered.

               APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

      JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in the judgment.
       The Court is correct, in my view, to hold that the chal
    lenged portions of 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248 are necessary and
    proper exercises of congressional authority.
       Respondents argue that congressional authority under
    the Necessary and Proper Clause can be no more than one
    step removed from an enumerated power. This is incor
    rect. When the inquiry is whether a federal law has suffi
    cient links to an enumerated power to be within the scope
    of federal authority, the analysis depends not on the num
    ber of links in the congressional-power chain but on the
    strength of the chain.
       Concluding that a relation can be put into a verbal
    formulation that fits somewhere along a causal chain of
    federal powers is merely the beginning, not the end, of the
    constitutional inquiry. See United States v. Lopez, 

[514 U.S. 549](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    , 566–567 (1995). The inferences must be con
    trolled by some limitations lest, as Thomas Jefferson
    warned, congressional powers become completely un
    bounded by linking one power to another ad infinitum in a
    veritable game of “ ‘this is the house that Jack built.’ ”

    30, 1800), 31 The Papers of Thomas Jefferson 547 (B.

       This separate writing serves two purposes. The first is
    to withhold assent from certain statements and proposi
    tions of the Court’s opinion. The second is to caution that
    the Constitution does require the invalidation of congres
    sional attempts to extend federal powers in some
    instances.
                                   I
       The Court concludes that, when determining whether
    Congress has the authority to enact a specific law under
    the Necessary and Proper Clause, we look “to see whether
    the statute constitutes a means that is rationally related
    to the implementation of a constitutionally enumerated
    power.” Ante, at 6 (suggesting that Sabri v. United States,
    

[541 U.S. 600](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 605 (2004), adopts a “means-ends rational
    ity” test).
       The terms “rationally related” and “rational basis” must
    be employed with care, particularly if either is to be used
    as a stand-alone test. The phrase “rational basis” most
    often is employed to describe the standard for determining
    whether legislation that does not proscribe fundamental
    liberties nonetheless violates the Due Process Clause.
    Referring to this due process inquiry, and in what must be
    one of the most deferential formulations of the standard
    for reviewing legislation in all the Court’s precedents, the
    Court has said: “But the law need not be in every respect
    logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is
    enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and
    that it might be thought that the particular legislative
    measure was a rational way to correct it.” Williamson v.
    Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 

[348 U.S. 483](/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/)

    
    
    , 487–488 (1955).
    This formulation was in a case presenting a due process
    challenge and a challenge to a State’s exercise of its own
    powers, powers not confined by the principles that control
    the limited nature of our National Government. The
    phrase, then, should not be extended uncritically to the
                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)            3
    
                   KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment
    
    issue before us.
        The operative constitutional provision in this case is the
    Necessary and Proper Clause. This Court has not held
    that the Lee Optical test, asking if “it might be thought
    that the particular legislative measure was a rational way
    to correct” an evil, is the proper test in this context.
    Rather, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, applica
    tion of a “rational basis” test should be at least as exacting
    as it has been in the Commerce Clause cases, if not more
    so. Indeed, the cases the Court cites in the portion of its
    opinion referring to “rational basis” are predominantly
    Commerce Clause cases, and none are due process cases.
    See ante, at 6 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 

[545 U.S. 1 ](/opinion/799995/gonzales-v-raich/)

    
    
    (2005);
    Lopez, supra; Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recla
    mation Assn., Inc., 

[452 U.S. 264](/opinion/110516/hodel-v-virginia-surface-mining-reclamation-
assn-inc/)

    
    
    , 276 (1981)).
        There is an important difference between the two ques
    tions, but the Court does not make this distinction clear.
    Raich, Lopez, and Hodel were all Commerce Clause cases.
    Those precedents require a tangible link to commerce, not
    a mere conceivable rational relation, as in Lee Optical.
    “ ‘[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particu
    lar activity substantially affects interstate commerce does
    not necessarily make it so.’ ” 

[Lopez, supra, at 557](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    , n. 2
    (quoting 

[Hodel, supra, at 311 ](/opinion/110516/hodel-v-virginia-surface-mining-
reclamation-assn-inc/)

    
    
    (Rehnquist, J., concurring in
    judgment)). The rational basis referred to in the Com
    merce Clause context is a demonstrated link in fact, based
    on empirical demonstration. While undoubtedly deferen
    tial, this may well be different from the rational-basis test
    as Lee Optical described it.
        The Court relies on 

[Sabri, supra](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , for its conclusion that
    a “means-ends rationality” is all that is required for a
    power to come within the Necessary and Proper Clause’s
    reach. See ante, at 6. Sabri only refers to “means-ends
    rationality” in a parenthetical describing the holding in
    McCulloch v. Maryland, 

[4 Wheat. 316 ](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    (1819); it certainly
    did not import the Lee Optical rational-basis test into this
    4              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                  KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment
    
    arena through such a parenthetical. See 

[Sabri, supra](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , at
    612 (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (“A statute can
    have a ‘rational’ connection to an enumerated power with
    out being obviously or clearly tied to that enumerated
    power”). It should be remembered, moreover, that the
    spending power is not designated as such in the Constitu
    tion but rather is implied from the power to lay and collect
    taxes and other specified exactions in order, among other
    purposes, “to pay the Debts and provide for the common
    Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” Art. I,
    §8, cl. 1; see South Dakota v. Dole, 

[483 U.S. 203](/opinion/111939/south-dakota-v-dole/)

    
    
    , 206
    (1987). The limits upon the spending power have not been
    much discussed, but if the relevant standard is parallel to
    the Commerce Clause cases, then the limits and the ana
    lytic approach in those precedents should be respected.
       A separate concern stems from the Court’s explanation
    of the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 16. I had thought it a
    basic principle that the powers reserved to the States
    consist of the whole, undefined residuum of power remain
    ing after taking account of powers granted to the National
    Government. The Constitution delegates limited powers
    to the National Government and then reserves the re
    mainder for the States (or the people), not the other way
    around, as the Court’s analysis suggests. And the powers
    reserved to the States are so broad that they remain unde
    fined. Residual power, sometimes referred to (perhaps
    imperfectly) as the police power, belongs to the States and
    the States alone.
       It is correct in one sense to say that if the National
    Government has the power to act under the Necessary and
    Proper Clause then that power is not one reserved to the
    States. But the precepts of federalism embodied in the
    Constitution inform which powers are properly exercised
    by the National Government in the first place. See 

Lopez, [514 U.S., at 580](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    –581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring); see also
    

McCulloch, supra, at 421

    
    
    (powers “consist[ent] with the
                      Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)             5
    
                   KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment
    
    letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional”). It
    is of fundamental importance to consider whether essen
    tial attributes of state sovereignty are compromised by the
    assertion of federal power under the Necessary and Proper
    Clause; if so, that is a factor suggesting that the power is
    not one properly within the reach of federal power.
       The opinion of the Court should not be interpreted to
    hold that the only, or even the principal, constraints on
    the exercise of congressional power are the Constitution’s
    express prohibitions. The Court’s discussion of the Tenth
    Amendment invites the inference that restrictions flowing
    from the federal system are of no import when defining
    the limits of the National Government’s power, as it pro
    ceeds by first asking whether the power is within the
    National Government’s reach, and if so it discards federal
    ism concerns entirely.
       These remarks explain why the Court ignores important
    limitations stemming from federalism principles. Those
    principles are essential to an understanding of the func
    tion and province of the States in our constitutional
    structure.
                                  II
       As stated at the outset, in this case Congress has acted
    within its powers to ensure that an abrupt end to the
    federal detention of prisoners does not endanger third
    parties. Federal prisoners often lack a single home State
    to take charge of them due to their lengthy prison stays, so
    it is incumbent on the National Government to act. This
    obligation, parallel in some respects to duties defined in
    tort law, is not to put in motion a particular force (here an
    unstable and dangerous person) that endangers others.
    Having acted within its constitutional authority to detain
    the person, the National Government can acknowledge a
    duty to ensure that an abrupt end to the detention does
    not prejudice the States and their citizens.
    6              UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                  KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment
    
       I would note, as the Court’s opinion does, that §4248
    does not supersede the right and responsibility of the
    States to identify persons who ought to be subject to civil
    confinement. The federal program in question applies
    only to those in federal custody and thus involves little
    intrusion upon the ordinary processes and powers of the
    States.
       This is not a case in which the National Government
    demands that a State use its own governmental system to
    implement federal commands. See Printz v. United States,
    

[521 U.S. 898 ](/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/)

    
    
    (1997). It is not a case in which the Na
    tional Government relieves the States of their own pri
    mary responsibility to enact laws and policies for the
    safety and well being of their citizens. See United States
    v. Morrison, 

[529 U.S. 598 ](/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/)

    
    
    (2000). Nor is it a case in which
    the exercise of national power intrudes upon functions and
    duties traditionally committed to the State. See 

[Lopez, supra, at 580](/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/)

    
    
    –581 (KENNEDY, J., concurring).
       Rather, this is a discrete and narrow exercise of author
    ity over a small class of persons already subject to the
    federal power. Importantly, §4248(d) requires the Attor
    ney General to release any civil detainee “to the appropri
    ate official of the State in which the person is domiciled or
    was tried if such State will assume responsibility for his
    custody, care, and treatment,” providing a strong assur
    ance that the proffered reason for the legislation’s neces
    sity is not a mere artifice.
       With these observations, I concur in the judgment of the
    Court.

       JUSTICE ALITO, concurring in the judgment.
       I am concerned about the breadth of the Court’s lan
    guage, see ante, at 2–4 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg
    ment), and the ambiguity of the standard that the Court
    applies, see post, at 9 (THOMAS, J., dissenting), but I am
    persuaded, on narrow grounds, that it was “necessary and
    proper” for Congress to enact the statute at issue in this
    case, 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248, in order to “carr[y] into Execution”
    powers specifically conferred on Congress by the Constitu
    tion, see Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
       Section 4248 was enacted to protect the public from
    federal prisoners who suffer from “a serious mental ill
    ness, abnormality, or disorder” and who, if released, would
    have “serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent
    conduct or child molestation.”        See §§4247(a)(5), (6),
    4248(d). Under this law, if neither the State of a pris
    oner’s domicile nor the State in which the prisoner was
    tried will assume the responsibility for the prisoner’s
    “custody, care, and treatment,” the Federal Government is
    authorized to undertake that responsibility. §4248(d).
    The statute recognizes that, in many cases, no State will
    assume the heavy financial burden of civilly committing a
    dangerous federal prisoner who, as a result of lengthy
    federal incarceration, no longer has any substantial ties to
    any State.
    2                   UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                        ALITO, J., concurring in judgment
    
      I entirely agree with the dissent that “[t]he Necessary
    and Proper Clause empowers Congress to enact only those
    laws that ‘carr[y] into Execution’ one or more of the federal
    powers enumerated in the Constitution,” post, at 1, but
    §4248 satisfies that requirement because it is a necessary
    and proper means of carrying into execution the enumer
    ated powers that support the federal criminal statutes
    under which the affected prisoners were convicted. The
    Necessary and Proper Clause provides the constitutional
    authority for most federal criminal statutes. In other
    words, most federal criminal statutes rest upon a congres
    sional judgment that, in order to execute one or more of
    the powers conferred on Congress, it is necessary and
    proper to criminalize certain conduct, and in order to do
    that it is obviously necessary and proper to provide for the
    operation of a federal criminal justice system and a federal
    prison system.
      All of this has been recognized since the beginning of
    our country. The First Congress enacted federal criminal
    laws,1 created federal law enforcement and prosecutorial
    positions,2 established a federal court system,3 provided
    for the imprisonment of persons convicted of federal
    crimes,4 and gave United States marshals the responsibil

    ity of securing federal prisoners.5
       The only additional question presented here is whether,
    in order to carry into execution the enumerated powers on
    which the federal criminal laws rest, it is also necessary
    and proper for Congress to protect the public from dangers
    created by the federal criminal justice and prison systems.
    In my view, the answer to that question is “yes.” Just as it
    is necessary and proper for Congress to provide for the
    apprehension of escaped federal prisoners, it is necessary
    and proper for Congress to provide for the civil commit
    ment of dangerous federal prisoners who would otherwise
    escape civil commitment as a result of federal imprison
    ment.
       Some years ago, a distinguished study group created by
    the Judicial Conference of the United States found that, in
    a disturbing number of cases, no State was willing to
    assume the financial burden of providing for the civil
    commitment of federal prisoners who, if left at large after
    the completion of their sentences, would present a danger
    to any communities in which they chose to live or visit.

    (“[T]he

    prisoners which may be in his custody at the time of his removal, or

    shall be appointed and qualified as the law directs”).

                    ALITO, J., concurring in judgment
    
    for years in a federal prison, often had few ties to any
    State; it was a matter of speculation where they would
    choose to go upon release; and accordingly no State was
    enthusiastic about volunteering to shoulder the burden of
    civil commitment.
      The Necessary and Proper Clause does not give Con
    gress carte blanche. Although the term “necessary” does
    not mean “absolutely necessary” or indispensable, the
    term requires an “appropriate” link between a power
    conferred by the Constitution and the law enacted by
    Congress. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 

[4 Wheat. 316](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 415
    (1819). And it is an obligation of this Court to enforce
    compliance with that limitation. 

[Id., at 423. ](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
      The law in question here satisfies that requirement.
    This is not a case in which it is merely possible for a court
    to think of a rational basis on which Congress might have
    perceived an attenuated link between the powers underly
    ing the federal criminal statutes and the challenged civil
    commitment provision. Here, there is a substantial link to
    Congress’ constitutional powers.
      For this reason, I concur in the judgment that Congress
    had the constitutional authority to enact

               APPEALS FOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT

      JUSTICE THOMAS, with whom JUSTICE SCALIA joins in
    all but Part III–A–1–b, dissenting.
      The Court holds today that Congress has power under
    the Necessary and Proper Clause to enact a law authoriz
    ing the Federal Government to civilly commit “sexually
    dangerous person[s]” beyond the date it lawfully could
    hold them on a charge or conviction for a federal crime.

    . §4248(a). I disagree. The Necessary and Proper
    Clause empowers Congress to enact only those laws that
    “carr[y] into Execution” one or more of the federal powers
    enumerated in the Constitution. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Because
    §4248 “Execut[es]” no enumerated power, I must respect
    fully dissent.

    powers are enumerated, and hence limited. See, e.g.,
    McCulloch v. Maryland,

    , 405 (1819) (“This
    government is acknowledged by all to be one of enumer
    ated powers”). Thus, Congress has no power to act unless
    the Constitution authorizes it to do so. United States v.

    by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers
    enumerated in the Constitution”). The States, in turn, are
    free to exercise all powers that the Constitution does not
    withhold from them. Amdt. 10 (“The powers not delegated
    to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by
    it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or
    to the people”).1 This constitutional structure establishes
    different default rules for Congress and the States: Con
    gress’ powers are “few and defined,” while those that
    belong to the States “remain . . . numerous and indefinite.”
    The Federalist No. 45, p. 328 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J.
    Madison).
       The Constitution plainly sets forth the “few and defined”
    powers that Congress may exercise. Article I “vest[s]” in
    Congress “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted,” §1, and
    carefully enumerates those powers in §8. The final clause
    of §8, the Necessary and Proper Clause, authorizes Con
    gress “[t]o make all Laws which shall be necessary and
    proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers,
    and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the
    Government of the United States, or in any Department or
    Officer thereof.” Art. I, §8, cl. 18. As the Clause’s place
    ment at the end of §8 indicates, the “foregoing Powers” are
    those granted to Congress in the preceding clauses of that
    section. The “other Powers” to which the Clause refers are
    those “vested” in Congress and the other branches by
    other specific provisions of the Constitution.
       Chief Justice Marshall famously summarized Congress’
    authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause in
    McCulloch, which has stood for nearly 200 years as this
    ——————
      1 “With this careful last phrase, the [Tenth] Amendment avoids tak

    exercise.” U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,

    Court’s definitive interpretation of that text:
        “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of
        the constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
        which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not
        prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
        constitution, are 

constitutional.” [4 Wheat., at 421](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-
maryland/)

    
    
    .
       McCulloch’s summation is descriptive of the Clause
    itself, providing that federal legislation is a valid exercise
    of Congress’ authority under the Clause if it satisfies a
    two-part test: First, the law must be directed toward a
    “legitimate” end, which McCulloch defines as one “within
    the scope of the [C]onstitution”—that is, the powers ex
    pressly delegated to the Federal Government by some
    provision in the Constitution. Second, there must be a
    necessary and proper fit between the “means” (the federal
    law) and the “end” (the enumerated power or powers) it is
    designed to serve. 

[Ibid.](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/) McCulloch accords
Congress

    
    
    a
    certain amount of discretion in assessing means-end fit
    under this second inquiry. The means Congress selects
    will be deemed “necessary” if they are “appropriate” and
    “plainly adapted” to the exercise of an enumerated power,
    and “proper” if they are not otherwise “prohibited” by the
    Constitution and not “[in]consistent” with its “letter and
    spirit.” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/) Critically, however,
McCulloch

    
    
    underscores the linear
    relationship the Clause establishes between the two in
    quiries: Unless the end itself is “legitimate,” the fit be
    tween means and end is irrelevant. In other words, no
    matter how “necessary” or “proper” an Act of Congress
    may be to its objective, Congress lacks authority to legis
    late if the objective is anything other than “carrying into
    Execution” one or more of the Federal Government’s enu
    merated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18.
       This limitation was of utmost importance to the Fram
    ers.     During the State ratification debates, Anti
    4                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                            THOMAS, J., dissenting
    
    Federalists expressed concern that the Necessary and
    Proper Clause would give Congress virtually unlimited
    power. See, e.g., Essays of Brutus, in 2 The Complete
    Anti-Federalist 421 (H. Storing ed. 1981). Federalist
    supporters of the Constitution swiftly refuted that charge,
    explaining that the Clause did not grant Congress any
    freestanding authority, but instead made explicit what
    was already implicit in the grant of each enumerated
    power. Referring to the “powers declared in the Constitu
    tion,” Alexander Hamilton noted that “it is expressly to
    execute these powers that the sweeping clause . . . author
    izes the national legislature to pass all necessary and
    proper laws.” The Federalist No. 33, at 245. James Madi
    son echoed this view, stating that “the sweeping clause . . .
    only extend[s] to the enumerated powers.” 3 J. Elliot, The
    Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption
    of the Federal Constitution 455 (2d ed. 1854) (hereinafter
    Elliot). Statements by delegates to the state ratification
    conventions indicate that this understanding was widely
    held by the founding generation. E.g., 

id., at 245–246

    
    
    (statement of George Nicholas) (“Suppose [the Necessary
    and Proper Clause] had been inserted, at the end of every
    power, that they should have power to make laws to carry
    that power into execution; would that have increased their
    powers? If, therefore, it could not have increased their
    powers, if placed at the end of each power, it cannot in
    crease them at the end of all”).2

    dangerous,”4 a court may order the person committed until
    he is no longer a risk “to others,” even if that does not
    occur until after his federal criminal sentence has expired
    or the statute of limitations on the federal charge against
    him has run. §§4248(a), (d)–(e).
      No enumerated power in Article I, §8, expressly dele
    gates to Congress the power to enact a civil-commitment
    regime for sexually dangerous persons, nor does any other
    provision in the Constitution vest Congress or the other
    branches of the Federal Government with such a power.
    Accordingly, §4248 can be a valid exercise of congressional
    authority only if it is “necessary and proper for carrying
    into Execution” one or more of those federal powers actu
    ally enumerated in the Constitution.
      Section 4248 does not fall within any of those powers.
    The Government identifies no specific enumerated power
    or powers as a constitutional predicate for §4248, and none
    are readily discernable. Indeed, not even the Commerce
    Clause—the enumerated power this Court has interpreted
    most expansively, see, e.g., NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin
    Steel Corp., 

[301 U.S. 1](/opinion/102804/nlrb-v-jones-laughlin-steel-corp/)

    
    
    , 37 (1937)—can justify federal civil
    detention of sex offenders. Under the Court’s precedents,
    Congress may not regulate noneconomic activity (such as
    sexual violence) based solely on the effect such activity
    may have, in individual cases or in the aggregate, on
    interstate commerce.

    difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molesta

    Government has never argued otherwise, see Tr. of Oral

      This Court, moreover, consistently has recognized that
    the power to care for the mentally ill and, where neces
    sary, the power “to protect the community from the dan
    gerous tendencies of some” mentally ill persons, are
    among the numerous powers that remain with the States.

[441 U.S. 418](/opinion/110067/addington-v-texas/)

    quence, we have held that States may “take measures to
    restrict the freedom of the dangerously mentally ill”—
    including those who are sexually dangerous—provided
    that such commitments satisfy due process and other
    constitutional requirements. Kansas v. Hendricks, 

[521 U.S. 346](/opinion/118136/kansas-v-hendricks/)

      Section 4248 closely resembles the involuntary civil
    commitment laws that States have enacted under their
    parens patriae and general police powers. Indeed, it is
    clear, on the face of the Act and in the Government’s
    arguments urging its constitutionality, that §4248 is
    aimed at protecting society from acts of sexual violence,
    not toward “carrying into Execution” any enumerated
    power or powers of the Federal Government. See Adam
    Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, 120 Stat.
    587 (entitled “[a]n Act [t]o protect children from sexual
    exploitation and violent crime”), §102,

    these prisoners’ release, even when that harm might arise

    ——————
       5 For the reasons explained in Part III–A–2, infra, the enumerated
    
    power that justifies a particular defendant’s criminal arrest or convic
    tion cannot justify his subsequent civil detention under §4248.

      To be sure, protecting society from violent sexual of
    fenders is certainly an important end. Sexual abuse is a
    despicable act with untold consequences for the victim
    personally and society generally. See, e.g., Kennedy v.
    Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___, ___, n. 2, (2008) (ALITO, J., dis
    senting) (slip op., at 9, n. 2, 22–23). But the Constitution
    does not vest in Congress the authority to protect society
    from every bad act that might befall it.6 New York v.
    United States, 

[505 U.S. 144](/opinion/112768/new-york-v-united-states/)

[297 U.S. 1](/opinion/102580/united-states-v-butler/)

    
    
    , 63 (1936)).
      In my view, this should decide the question. Section
    4248 runs afoul of our settled understanding of Congress’
    power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Congress
    may act under that Clause only when its legislation
    “carr[ies] into Execution” one of the Federal Government’s
    enumerated powers. Art. I, §8, cl. 18. Section 4248 does
    not execute any enumerated power. Section 4248 is there
    fore unconstitutional.
                                 III
       The Court perfunctorily genuflects to McCulloch’s
    framework for assessing Congress’ Necessary and Proper
    Clause authority, and to the principle of dual sovereignty
    it helps to maintain, then promptly abandons both in favor
    of a novel five-factor test supporting its conclusion that
    §4248 is a “ ‘necessary and proper’ ” adjunct to a jumble of
    unenumerated “authorit[ies].” Ante, at 22. The Court’s

      6 The absence of a constitutional delegation of general police power to
    
    Congress does not leave citizens vulnerable to the harms Congress
    seeks to regulate in §4248 because, as recent legislation indicates, the
    States have the capacity to address the threat that sexual offenders
    pose. See n. 15, infra.

    preting it. It also raises more questions than it answers.
    Must each of the five considerations exist before the Court
    sustains future federal legislation as proper exercises of
    Congress’ Necessary and Proper Clause authority? What
    if the facts of a given case support a finding of only four
    considerations? Or three? And if three or four will suffice,
    which three or four are imperative? At a minimum, this
    shift from the two-step McCulloch framework to this five
    consideration approach warrants an explanation as to why
    McCulloch is no longer good enough and which of the five
    considerations will bear the most weight in future cases,
    assuming some number less than five suffices. (Or, if not,
    why all five are required.) The Court provides no answers
    to these questions.
                                A
      I begin with the first and last “considerations” in the
    Court’s inquiry. Ante, at 5. The Court concludes that
    §4248 is a valid exercise of Congress’ Necessary and
    Proper Clause authority because that authority is “broad,”
    ibid., and because “the links between §4248 and an enu
    merated Article I power are not too attenuated,” ante, at
    18. In so doing, the Court first inverts, then misapplies,
    McCulloch’s straightforward two-part test.
                                 1
                                 a
      First, the Court describes Congress’ lawmaking power
    under the Necessary and Proper Clause as “broad,” relying
    on precedents that have upheld federal laws under the
    Clause after finding a “ ‘rationa[l]’ ” fit between the law
    and an enumerated power. Ante, at 6 (quoting Sabri v.
    United States, 

[541 U.S. 600](/opinion/134745/sabri-v-united-states/)

    
    
    , 605 (2004)). It is true that
    this Court’s precedents allow Congress a certain degree of
    latitude in selecting the means for “carrying into Execu
    10                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                             THOMAS, J., dissenting
    
    tion” an end that is “legitimate.”7 See, e.g., Jinks v. Rich
    land County, 

[538 U.S. 456](/opinion/127912/jinks-v-richland-county/)

    
    
    , 462–463 (2003) (citing
    

McCulloch, [4 Wheat., at 417](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    , 421). But in citing these
    cases, the Court puts the cart before the horse: The fit
    between means and ends matters only if the end is in fact
    legitimate—i.e., only if it is one of the Federal Govern
    ment’s enumerated powers.
       By starting its inquiry with the degree of deference
    owed to Congress in selecting means to further a legiti
    mate end, the Court bypasses McCulloch’s first step and
    fails carefully to examine whether the end served by §4248
    is actually one of those powers. See Part III–A–2, infra.
                                 b
      Second, instead of asking the simple question of what

      7 JUSTICE KENNEDY concludes that the Necessary and Proper Clause
    requires something beyond rational-basis scrutiny when assessing the
    fit between an enumerated power and the means Congress selects to
    execute it. Ante, at 2–4 (opinion concurring in judgment). Other
    arguments regarding the degree of fit between means and end have
    been lodged elsewhere. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Raich,

    Necessary and Proper Clause, it must bear an “ ‘obvious, simple, and
    direct relation’ ” to an exercise of Congress’ enumerated powers and
    must not subvert basic principles of federalism and dual sovereignty).
    But I find that debate beside the point here, because it concerns the

    power.
       The Court observes that Congress has the undisputed
    authority to “criminalize conduct” that interferes with
    enumerated powers; to “imprison individuals who engage
    in that conduct”; to “enact laws governing [those] prisons”;
    and to serve as a “custodian of its prisoners.” Ante, at 9,
    14. From this, the Court assumes that §4248 must also be
    a valid exercise of congressional power because it is “ ‘rea
    sonably adapted’ ” to those exercises of Congress’ inciden
    tal—and thus unenumerated—authorities. See ante, at 15
    (concluding that “§4248 is ‘reasonably adapted’ to Con
    gress’ power to act as a responsible federal custodian”
    (citation omitted)); ante, at 22 (concluding that “the stat
    ute is a ‘necessary and proper’ means of exercising the
    federal authority that permits Congress to create federal
    criminal laws, to punish their violation, to imprison viola
    tors, to provide appropriately for those imprisoned, and to
    maintain the security of those who are not imprisoned but
    who may be affected by the federal imprisonment of oth
    ers”). But that is not the question. The Necessary and
    Proper Clause does not provide Congress with authority to
    enact any law simply because it furthers other laws Con
    gress has enacted in the exercise of its incidental author
    ity; the Clause plainly requires a showing that every
    federal statute “carr[ies] into Execution” one or more of
    the Federal Government’s enumerated powers.8
    ——————
      8 McCulloch   makes this point clear. As the Court notes, ante, at 18–
    19, McCulloch states, in discussing a hypothetical, that from Congress’
    enumerated power to establish post offices and post roads “has been
    inferred the power and duty of carrying the mail,” and, “from this
    implied power, has again been inferred the right to punish those who
    steal letters from the post office, or rob the 

mail.” [4 Wheat., at 417](/opinion/85272/mculloch-v-state-of-maryland/)

    
    
    .
    Contrary to the Court’s interpretation, this dictum does not suggest
    that the relationship between Congress’ implied power to punish postal
    crimes and its implied power to carry the mail is alone sufficient to
    satisfy review under the Necessary and Proper Clause. Instead,
    McCulloch directly links the constitutionality of the former to Congress’
    12                 UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                             THOMAS, J., dissenting
    
      Federal laws that criminalize conduct that interferes
    with enumerated powers, establish prisons for those who
    engage in that conduct, and set rules for the care and
    treatment of prisoners awaiting trial or serving a criminal
    sentence satisfy this test because each helps to “carr[y]
    into Execution” the enumerated powers that justify a
    criminal defendant’s arrest or conviction. For example,
    Congress’ enumerated power “[t]o establish Post Offices
    and post Roads,” Art. I, §8, cl. 7, would lack force or practi
    cal effect if Congress lacked the authority to enact crimi
    nal laws “to punish those who steal letters from the post
    office, or rob the mail.” 

McCulloch, supra, at 417

    
    
    . Simi
    larly, that enumerated power would be compromised if
    there were no prisons to hold persons who violate those
    laws, or if those prisons were so poorly managed that
    prisoners could escape or demand their release on the
    grounds that the conditions of their confinement violate
    their constitutional rights, at least as we have defined
    them. See, e.g., Estelle v. Gamble,

    importantly, McCulloch’s holding, as well as the holdings of this Court’s

    Civil detention under §4248, on the other hand, lacks any
    such connection to an enumerated power.
                                   2
       After focusing on the relationship between §4248 and
    several of Congress’ implied powers, the Court finally
    concludes that the civil detention of a “sexually dangerous
    person” under §4248 carries into execution the enumer
    ated power that justified that person’s arrest or conviction
    in the first place. In other words, the Court analogizes
    §4248 to federal laws that authorize prison officials to care
    for federal inmates while they serve sentences or await
    trial. But while those laws help to “carr[y] into Execution”
    the enumerated power that justifies the imposition of
    criminal sanctions on the inmate, §4248 does not bear that
    essential characteristic for three reasons.
       First, the statute’s definition of a “sexually dangerous
    person” contains no element relating to the subject’s
    crime. See §§4247(a)(5)–(6). It thus does not require a
    federal court to find any connection between the reasons
    supporting civil commitment and the enumerated power
    with which that person’s criminal conduct interfered. As a
    consequence, §4248 allows a court to civilly commit an
    individual without finding that he was ever charged with
    or convicted of a federal crime involving sexual violence.
    §§4248(a), (d). That possibility is not merely hypothetical:
    The Government concedes that nearly 20% of individuals
    against whom §4248 proceedings have been brought fit
    this description.9 Tr. of Oral Arg. 23–25.
       Second, §4248 permits the term of federal civil commit
    ment to continue beyond the date on which a convicted
    ——————
      9 The statute does require the court to find that the subject “has en
    
    gaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child
    molestation,” §4247(a)(5), but that factual predicate can be established
    by a state conviction, or by clear and convincing evidence that the
    person committed a sex crime for which he was never charged.
    14             UNITED STATES v. COMSTOCK
    
                        THOMAS, J., dissenting
    
    prisoner’s sentence expires or the date on which the stat
    ute of limitations on an untried defendant’s crime has run.
    The statute therefore authorizes federal custody over a
    person at a time when the Government would lack juris
    diction to detain him for violating a criminal law that
    executes an enumerated power.
       The statute this Court upheld in Greenwood v. United
    States, 

[350 U.S. 366 ](/opinion/105356/greenwood-v-united-states/)

    
    
    (1956), provides a useful contrast.
    That statute authorized the Federal Government to exer
    cise civil custody over a federal defendant declared men
    tally unfit to stand trial only “ ‘until the accused shall be
    mentally competent to stand trial or until the pending
    charges against him are disposed of according to law.’ ”

    n. 2 (quoting 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4246 (1952 ed.)).
    Thus, that statute’s “end” reasonably could be interpreted
    as preserving the Government’s power to enforce a crimi
    nal law against the accused. Section 4248 (2006 ed.),
    however, authorizes federal detention of a person even
    after the Government loses the authority to prosecute him
    for a federal crime.
       Third, the definition of a “sexually dangerous person”
    relevant to §4248 does not require the court to find that
    the person is likely to violate a law executing an enumer
    ated power in the future. Although the Federal Govern
    ment has no express power to regulate sexual violence
    generally, Congress has passed a number of laws proscrib
    ing such conduct in special circumstances. All of these
    statutes contain jurisdictional elements that require a
    connection to one of Congress’ enumerated powers—such
    as interstate commerce, e.g., §2252(a)(2)—or that limit the
    statute’s coverage to jurisdictions in which Congress has
    plenary authority, e.g., §2243(a). Section 4248, by con
    trast, authorizes civil commitment upon a showing that
    the person is “sexually dangerous,” and presents a risk “to
    others,” §4247(a)(5). It requires no evidence that this
    sexually dangerous condition will manifest itself in a way
                          Cite as: 560 U. S. ____ (2010)                       15

    that interferes with a federal law that executes an enu
    merated power or in a geographic location over which
    Congress has plenary authority.10
      In sum, the enumerated powers that justify a criminal
    defendant’s arrest or conviction cannot justify his subse
    quent civil detention under §4248.
                                  B
      The remaining “considerations” in the Court’s five-part
    inquiry do not alter this conclusion.
                                  1
      First, in a final attempt to analogize §4248 to laws that
    authorize the Federal Government to provide care and
    treatment to prisoners while they await trial or serve a
    criminal sentence, the Court cites the Second Restatement
    of Torts for the proposition that the Federal Government
    has a “custodial interest” in its prisoners, ante, at 22, and,
    thus, a broad “constitutional power to act in order to pro
    tect nearby (and other) communities” from the dangers

       10 The Constitution grants Congress plenary authority over certain
    
    jurisdictions where no other sovereign exists, including the District of
    Columbia, Art. I, §8, cl. 17, and federal territories, Art. IV, §3, cl. 2. In
    addition, Congress has “broad general powers to legislate in respect to
    Indian tribes,” United States v. Lara, 

[541 U.S. 193](/opinion/134732/united-states-v-lara/)

    ties over “Indian country,” 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1151. Although the Necessary
    and Proper Clause did not authorize Congress to enact §4248, I do not
    rule out the possibility that Congress could provide for the civil com
    mitment of individuals who enter federal custody as a result of acts
    committed in these jurisdictions. See, e.g., United States v. Cohen, 

[733 F.2d 128 ](/opinion/435001/united-states-v-jeffrey-i-cohen/)

    
    
    (CADC 1984) (en banc) (upholding civil commitment of a
    defendant under a District of Columbia statute authorizing the institu
    tionalization of persons acquitted by reason of insanity). Although two
    of the respondents in this case were either charged with or convicted of
    criminal acts committed in such jurisdictions, see ante, at 3; 

[507 F. Supp. 2d 522](/opinion/2251930/united-states-v-comstock/)

    
    
    , 527, and n. 2 (EDNC 2007), that question is not
    presented here because §4248 does not make that fact essential to an
    individual’s placement in civil detention.

    they may pose,11 ante, at 14. That citation is puzzling
    because federal authority derives from the Constitution,
    not the common law. In any event, nothing in the Re
    statement suggests that a common-law custodian has the
    powers that Congress seeks here. While the Restatement
    provides that a custodian has a duty to take reasonable
    steps to ensure that a person in his care does not cause
    “bodily harm to others,” 2 Restatement (Second) of Torts
    §319, p. 129 (1963–1964), that duty terminates once the
    legal basis for custody expires:
         “There is no duty so to control the conduct of a third
         person as to prevent him from causing physical harm
         to another unless
            “(a) a special relation exists between the actor and
         the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor
         to control the third person’s conduct, or
            “(b) a special relation exists between the actor and
         the other which gives to the other a right to protec
         tion.” 

Id., §315, at

    Once the Federal Government’s criminal jurisdiction over
    a prisoner ends, so does any “special relation[ship]” be
    tween the Government and the former prisoner.12
    ——————
      11 The Court also cites Youngberg v. Romeo, 

[457 U.S. 307 ](/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/)

    
    
    (1982), but
    
    that case lends even less support than the Restatement. In Youngberg,
    an inmate at a state hospital argued that hospital workers violated his
    constitutional rights when they applied restraints to keep him in his
    bed at the hospital infirmary. 

[Id., at 310–311. ](/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/)

    
    
    In assessing that claim,
    this Court noted that the hospital had a responsibility to “protect its
    residents” from the danger of violence. 

[Id., at 320 ](/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/)

    
    
    (emphasis added).
    The Court never suggested that this responsibility extended to “nearby
    (and other) communities.” Ante, at 14. Moreover, the hospital was a
    state institution. Nothing in Youngberg suggests that the Federal
    Government can detain a person beyond the date on which its criminal
    jurisdiction expires for fear that he may later pose a threat to the
    surrounding community.

       For this reason, I cannot agree with JUSTICE ALITO that
    §4248 is a necessary and proper incident of Congress’
    power “to protect the public from dangers created by the
    federal criminal justice and prison systems.” Ante, at 3
    (concurring in judgment). A federal criminal defendant’s
    “sexually dangerous” propensities are not “created by” the
    fact of his incarceration or his relationship with the fed
    eral prison system. The fact that the Federal Government
    has the authority to imprison a person for the purpose of
    punishing him for a federal crime—sex-related or other
    wise—does not provide the Government with the addi
    tional power to exercise indefinite civil control over that
    person.13
                                 2
      Second, the Court describes §4248 as a “modest” expan
    sion on a statutory framework with a long historical pedi
    gree. Ante, at 9. Yet even if the antiquity of a practice
    could serve as a substitute for its constitutionality—and
    the Court admits that it cannot, ibid.—the Court over
    states the relevant history.
      Congress’ first foray into this general area occurred in
    1855, when it established St. Elizabeth’s Hospital to pro

    . §§3583, 3624(e). Contrary to the Government’s
    suggestion, federal authority to exercise control over individuals
    serving terms of “supervised release” does not derive from the Govern
    ment’s “relationship” with the prisoner, see Brief for United States 38,
    but from the original criminal sentence itself. Supervised release thus
    serves to execute the enumerated power that justifies the defendant’s
    statute of conviction, just like any other form of punishment imposed at
    sentencing.
       13 The fact that Congress has the authority to “provide for the appre
    
    hension of escaped federal prisoners,” see ante, at 3 (ALITO, J., concur
    ring in judgment), does not change this conclusion. That authority
    derives from Congress’ power to vindicate the enumerated power with
    which the escaped defendant’s crime of conviction interfered, not a
    freestanding police power.

    But Congress was acting pursuant to enumerated powers
    when it took this step. See Art. I, §8, cl. 17 (granting
    Congress plenary authority over the District of Columbia);
    Art. I, §8, cl. 14 (authorizing Congress to “make Rules for

    for Congress’ claimed power to detain sexually dangerous
    persons without an otherwise valid basis for jurisdiction.

    ment of “insane” persons charged with or convicted of a
    federal crime. Act of Feb. 7, 1857, §§5–6, 11 Stat. 158; see
    17 Op. Atty. Gen. 211, 212–213 (1881); Act of June 23,

    330. As the Court explains, however, these statutes did
    not authorize federal custody beyond the completion of the
    “term” of federal “imprisonment,” §§2–3, 18 Stat. 252; see

    thus supports the Federal Gov

    it provides no justification whatsoever for reading the
    Necessary and Proper Clause to grant Congress the power

      Finally, the Court offers two arguments regarding
    §4248’s impact on the relationship between the Federal
    Government and the States. First, the Court and both
    concurrences suggest that Congress must have had the
    power to enact §4248 because a long period of federal
    incarceration might “seve[r]” a sexually dangerous pris
    oner’s “claim to ‘legal residence’ ” in any particular State,
    ante, at 15 (opinion of the Court), thus leaving the pris
    oner without any “home State to take charge” of him upon
    release, ante, at 5 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);

    see ante, at 1 (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment) (noting
    that many federal prisoners, “as a result of lengthy federal
    incarceration, no longer ha[ve] any substantial ties to any
    State”). I disagree with the premise of that argument. As
    an initial matter, States plainly have the constitutional
    authority to “take charge” of a federal prisoner released
    within their jurisdiction. See Amdt. 10 (stating that pow
    ers not delegated to the Federal Government are “re
    served” to the States, and to the people). In addition, the
    assumption that a State knowingly would fail to exercise
    that authority is, in my view, implausible. The Govern
    ment stated at oral argument that its “default position” is
    to release a federal prisoner to the State in which he was
    convicted, Tr. of Oral Arg. 15; see also 28 CFR §2.33(b)
    (2009), and neither the Court nor the concurrences argue
    that a State has the power to refuse such a person domi
    cile within its borders. Thus, they appear to assume that,
    in the absence of 

18 U.S. C

    
    
    . §4248, a State would take no
    action when informed by the BOP that a sexually danger
    ous federal prisoner was about to be released within its
    jurisdiction. In light of the plethora of state laws enacted
    in recent decades to protect communities from sex offend
    ers,15 the likelihood of such an occurrence seems quite

    impose residency restrictions on sex offenders, see, e.g., Kennedy v.
    Louisiana, 554 U. S. ___ , ___, n. 5 (2008) (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip
    op., at 11, n. 5) (collecting statutes), and, most relevant here, 22 States

    remote. But even in the event a State made such a deci
    sion, the Constitution assigns the responsibility for that
    decision, and its consequences, to the state government
    alone.
       Next, the Court submits that §4248 does not upset the
    balance of federalism or invade the States’ reserved pow
    ers because it “requires accommodation of state interests”
    by instructing the Attorney General to release a commit
    ted person to the State in which he was domiciled or tried
    if that State wishes to “ ‘assume . . . responsibility’ ” for
    him. Ante, at 17 (quoting §4248(d)). This right of first
    refusal is mere window dressing. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5 (“It is
    not the usual course that the State does take responsibil
    ity”). More importantly, it is an altogether hollow assur
    ance that §4248 preserves the principle of dual sover
    eignty—the “letter and spirit” of the Constitution—as the
    Necessary and Proper Clause requires.16 McCulloch, 4

       16 The Court describes my argument as a claim that “§4248 violates
    
    the Tenth Amendment.” Ante, at 16. Yet, I agree entirely with the
    Court that “ ‘it makes no difference whether one views the question at
    issue [here] as one of ascertaining the limits of the power delegated to
    the Federal Government under the affirmative provisions of the Consti
    tution or one of discerning the core of sovereignty retained by the
    States under the Tenth Amendment.’ ”

    , 159 (1992)). Section 4248 is unconstitu
    tional because it does not “carr[y] into Execution” an enumerated
    power. Therefore, it necessarily intrudes upon the powers our Consti

    see Art. VI, cl. 2. Section 4248’s right of first refusal is
    thus not a matter of constitutional necessity, but an act of
    legislative grace.
       Nevertheless, 29 States appear as amici and argue that
    §4248 is constitutional. They tell us that they do not
    object to Congress retaining custody of “sexually danger
    ous persons” after their criminal sentences expire because
    the cost of detaining such persons is “expensive”—
    approximately $64,000 per year—and these States would
    rather the Federal Government bear this expense. Brief
    for Kansas et al. 2; 

ibid. (“[S]ex offender civil

    programs are expensive to operate”);

       Congress’ power, however, is fixed by the Constitution;
    it does not expand merely to suit the States’ policy prefer
    ences, or to allow State officials to avoid difficult choices
    regarding the allocation of state funds. By assigning the
    Federal Government power over “certain enumerated
    objects only,” the Constitution “leaves to the several States
    a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other ob
    jects.” The Federalist No. 39, at 285 (J. Madison). The
    purpose of this design is to preserve the “balance of power
    between the States and the Federal Government . . . [that]
    protect[s] our fundamental liberties.” Garcia v. San Anto

    mediate and visible guardian” of those liberties because
    federal powers extend no further than those enumerated
    in the Constitution. The Federalist No. 17, at 169 (A.
    Hamilton). The Constitution gives States no more power
    to decline this responsibility than it gives them to infringe
    upon those liberties in the first instance. FTC v. Ticor

    , 636 (1992) (“Federalism
    serves to assign political responsibility, not to obscure it”).
      Absent congressional action that is in accordance with,
    or necessary and proper to, an enumerated power, the
    duty to protect citizens from violent crime, including acts
    of sexual violence, belongs solely to the States.

    Regrettably, today’s opinion breathes new life into that
    Clause, and—the Court’s protestations to the contrary
    notwithstanding, see ante, at 18—comes perilously close to
    transforming the Necessary and Proper Clause into a
    basis for the federal police power that “we always have
