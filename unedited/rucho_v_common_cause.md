    APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE
             MIDDLE DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA
    
         No. 18–422.      Argued March 26, 2019—Decided June 27, 2019*
    Voters and other plaintiffs in North Carolina and Maryland filed suits
      challenging their States’ congressional districting maps as unconsti-
      tutional partisan gerrymanders. The North Carolina plaintiffs
      claimed that the State’s districting plan discriminated against Demo-
      crats, while the Maryland plaintiffs claimed that their State’s plan
      discriminated against Republicans. The plaintiffs alleged violations
      of the First Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-
      teenth Amendment, the Elections Clause, and Article I, §2. The Dis-
      trict Courts in both cases ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and the de-
      fendants appealed directly to this Court.
    Held: Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions be-
      yond the reach of the federal courts. Pp. 6–34.
         (a) In these cases, the Court is asked to decide an important ques-
      tion of constitutional law. Before it does so, the Court “must find that
      the question is presented in a ‘case’ or ‘controversy’ that is . . . ‘of a
      Judiciary Nature.’ ” DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno,

      342. While it is “the province and duty of the judicial department to
      say what the law is,” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177, some-
      times the law is that the Judiciary cannot entertain a claim because
      it presents a nonjusticiable “political question,” Baker v. Carr, 

[369 U.S. 186](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    , 217. Among the political question cases this Court has
      identified are those that lack “judicially discoverable and manageable
      standards for resolving [them].” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/) This Court’s partisan

      mandering cases have left unresolved the question whether such

        See Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. ___, ___.
           Partisan gerrymandering was known in the Colonies prior to Inde-
        pendence, and the Framers were familiar with it at the time of the
        drafting and ratification of the Constitution. They addressed the
        election of Representatives to Congress in the Elections Clause,
        Art. I, §4, cl. 1, assigning to state legislatures the power to prescribe
        the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections” for Members of
        Congress, while giving Congress the power to “make or alter” any
        such regulations. Congress has regularly exercised its Elections
        Clause power, including to address partisan gerrymandering. But
        the Framers did not set aside all electoral issues as questions that
        only Congress can resolve. In two areas—one-person, one-vote and
        racial gerrymandering—this Court has held that there is a role for
        the courts with respect to at least some issues that could arise from a
        State’s drawing of congressional districts. But the history of partisan
        gerrymandering is not irrelevant. Aware of electoral districting prob-
        lems, the Framers chose a characteristic approach, assigning the is-
        sue to the state legislatures, expressly checked and balanced by the
        Federal Congress, with no suggestion that the federal courts had a
        role to play.
           Courts have nonetheless been called upon to resolve a variety of
        questions surrounding districting. The claim of population inequality
        among districts in Baker v. Carr, for example, could be decided under
        basic equal protection 

principles. [369 U.S., at 226](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    . Racial discrimi-
        nation in districting also raises constitutional issues that can be ad-
        dressed by the federal courts. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 

[364 U.S. 339](/opinion/106127/gomillion-v-lightfoot/)

    
    
    , 340. Partisan gerrymandering claims have proved far more dif-
        ficult to adjudicate, in part because “a jurisdiction may engage in
        constitutional political gerrymandering.” Hunt v. Cromartie, 

[526 U.S. 541](/opinion/1087691/hunt-v-cromartie/)

    
    
    , 551. To hold that legislators cannot take their partisan in-
        terests into account when drawing district lines would essentially
        countermand the Framers’ decision to entrust districting to political
        entities. The “central problem” is “determining when political ger-
        rymandering has gone too far.” Vieth v. Jubelirer,

    (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). The question is one of degree:
    How to “provid[e] a standard for deciding how much partisan domi-
    nance is too much.” 

LULAC, [548 U.S., at 420 ](/opinion/145627/league-of-united-latin-american-

    (opinion of Kennedy,
    J.). Partisan gerrymandering claims rest on an instinct that groups
    with a certain level of political support should enjoy a commensurate
    level of political power and influence. Such claims invariably sound
    in a desire for proportional representation, but the Constitution does
    not require proportional representation, and federal courts are nei-
    ther equipped nor authorized to apportion political power as a matter
    of fairness. It is not even clear what fairness looks like in this con-
    text. It may mean achieving a greater number of competitive dis-
    tricts by undoing packing and cracking so that supporters of the dis-
    advantaged party have a better shot at electing their preferred
    candidates. But it could mean engaging in cracking and packing to
    ensure each party its “appropriate” share of “safe” seats. Or perhaps
    it should be measured by adherence to “traditional” districting crite-
    ria. Deciding among those different visions of fairness poses basic
    questions that are political, not legal. There are no legal standards
    discernible in the Constitution for making such judgments. And it is
    only after determining how to define fairness that one can even begin
    to answer the determinative question: “How much is too much?”
       The fact that the Court can adjudicate one-person, one-vote claims
    does not mean that partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable.
    This Court’s one-person, one-vote cases recognize that each person is
    entitled to an equal say in the election of representatives. It hardly
    follows from that principle that a person is entitled to have his politi-
    cal party achieve representation commensurate to its share of
    statewide support. Vote dilution in the one-person, one-vote cases re-
    fers to the idea that each vote must carry equal weight. That re-
    quirement does not extend to political parties; it does not mean that
    each party must be influential in proportion to the number of its sup-
    porters. The racial gerrymandering cases are also inapposite: They
    call for the elimination of a racial classification, but a partisan ger-
    rymandering claim cannot ask for the elimination of partisanship.
    Pp. 15–21.
       (c) None of the proposed “tests” for evaluating partisan gerryman-
    dering claims meets the need for a limited and precise standard that
    is judicially discernible and manageable. Pp. 22–30.
          (1) The Common Cause District Court concluded that all but one
    of the districts in North Carolina’s 2016 Plan violated the Equal Pro-
    tection Clause by intentionally diluting the voting strength of Demo-
    4                      RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                                       Syllabus
    
        crats. It applied a three-part test, examining intent, effects, and cau-
        sation. The District Court’s “predominant intent” prong is borrowed
        from the test used in racial gerrymandering cases. However, unlike
        race-based decisionmaking, which is “inherently suspect,” Miller v.
        Johnson, 

[515 U.S. 900](/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/)

    
    
    , 915, districting for some level of partisan ad-
        vantage is not unconstitutional. Determining that lines were drawn
        on the basis of partisanship does not indicate that districting was
        constitutionally impermissible. The Common Cause District Court
        also required the plaintiffs to show that vote dilution is “likely to per-
        sist” to such a degree that the elected representatives will feel free to
        ignore the concerns of the supporters of the minority party. Experi-
        ence proves that accurately predicting electoral outcomes is not sim-
        ple, and asking judges to predict how a particular districting map
        will perform in future elections risks basing constitutional holdings
        on unstable ground outside judicial expertise. The District Court’s
        third prong—which gave the defendants an opportunity to show that
        discriminatory effects were due to a “legitimate redistricting objec-
        tive”—just restates the question asked at the “predominant intent”
        prong. Pp. 22–25.
             (2) The District Courts also found partisan gerrymandering
        claims justiciable under the First Amendment, coalescing around a
        basic three-part test: proof of intent to burden individuals based on
        their voting history or party affiliation, an actual burden on political
        speech or associational rights, and a causal link between the invidi-
        ous intent and actual burden. But their analysis offers no “clear” and
        “manageable” way of distinguishing permissible from impermissible
        partisan motivation. Pp. 25–27.
             (3) Using a State’s own districting criteria as a baseline from
        which to measure how extreme a partisan gerrymander is would be
        indeterminate and arbitrary. Doing so would still leave open the
        question of how much political motivation and effect is too much.
        Pp. 27–29.
    
            (4) The North Carolina District Court further held that the 2016
        Plan violated Article I, §2, and the Elections Clause, Art. I, §4, cl. 1.
        But the Vieth plurality concluded—without objection from any other
        Justice—that neither §2 nor §4 “provides a judicially enforceable limit
        on the political considerations that the States and Congress may
        take into account when 

districting.” [541 U.S., at 305](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    . Any assertion
        that partisan gerrymanders violate the core right of voters to choose
        their representatives is an objection more likely grounded in the
        Guarantee Clause of Article IV, §4, which “guarantee[s] to every
        State in [the] Union a Republican Form of Government.” This Court
        has several times concluded that the Guarantee Clause does not pro-

      vide the basis for a justiciable claim. See, e.g., Pacific States Tele-

    . Pp. 29–30.
         (d) The conclusion that partisan gerrymandering claims are not
      justiciable neither condones excessive partisan gerrymandering nor
      condemns complaints about districting to echo into a void. Numerous
      States are actively addressing the issue through state constitutional
      amendments and legislation placing power to draw electoral districts
      in the hands of independent commissions, mandating particular dis-
      tricting criteria for their mapmakers, or prohibiting drawing district
      lines for partisan advantage. The Framers also gave Congress the
      power to do something about partisan gerrymandering in the Elec-
      tions Clause. That avenue for reform established by the Framers,
      and used by Congress in the past, remains open. Pp. 30–34.

      CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the
    Court.
      Voters and other plaintiffs in North Carolina and Mary-
    land challenged their States’ congressional districting
    maps as unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders. The
    North Carolina plaintiffs complained that the State’s
    districting plan discriminated against Democrats; the
    Maryland plaintiffs complained that their State’s plan
    discriminated against Republicans. The plaintiffs alleged
    that the gerrymandering violated the First Amendment,
    the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
    ment, the Elections Clause, and Article I, §2, of the Con-
    stitution. The District Courts in both cases ruled in favor
    2                RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    of the plaintiffs, and the defendants appealed directly to
    this Court.
       These cases require us to consider once again whether
    claims of excessive partisanship in districting are “justici-
    able”—that is, properly suited for resolution by the federal
    courts. This Court has not previously struck down a
    districting plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerry-
    mander, and has struggled without success over the past
    several decades to discern judicially manageable stand-
    ards for deciding such claims. The districting plans at
    issue here are highly partisan, by any measure. The
    question is whether the courts below appropriately exer-
    cised judicial power when they found them unconstitu-
    tional as well.
                                  I
                                  A
      The first case involves a challenge to the congressional
    redistricting plan enacted by the Republican-controlled
    North Carolina General Assembly in 2016. Rucho v.
    Common Cause, No. 18–422. The Republican legislators
    leading the redistricting effort instructed their mapmaker
    to use political data to draw a map that would produce a
    congressional delegation of ten Republicans and three
    Democrats. 

318 F. Supp. 3d 777

    
    
    , 807–808 (MDNC 2018).
    As one of the two Republicans chairing the redistricting
    committee stated, “I think electing Republicans is better
    than electing Democrats. So I drew this map to help foster
    what I think is better for the country.” 

Id., at 809.

    
    
    He
    further explained that the map was drawn with the aim of
    electing ten Republicans and three Democrats because he
    did “not believe it [would be] possible to draw a map with
    11 Republicans and 2 Democrats.” 

Id., at 808.

    
    
    One Demo-
    cratic state senator objected that entrenching the 10–3
    advantage for Republicans was not “fair, reasonable, [or]
    balanced” because, as recently as 2012, “Democratic con-
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           3
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    gressional candidates had received more votes on a
    statewide basis than Republican candidates.” 

Ibid. The General Assembly

    
    
    was not swayed by that objection and
    approved the 2016 Plan by a party-line vote. 

Id., at 809.

    
    
      In November 2016, North Carolina conducted congres-
    sional elections using the 2016 Plan, and Republican
    candidates won 10 of the 13 congressional districts. 

Id., at 810\.

    
    
    In the 2018 elections, Republican candidates won
    nine congressional districts, while Democratic candidates
    won three. The Republican candidate narrowly prevailed
    in the remaining district, but the State Board of Elections
    called a new election after allegations of fraud.
      This litigation began in August 2016, when the North
    Carolina Democratic Party, Common Cause (a nonprofit
    organization), and 14 individual North Carolina voters
    sued the two lawmakers who had led the redistricting
    effort and other state defendants in Federal District
    Court. Shortly thereafter, the League of Women Voters of
    North Carolina and a dozen additional North Carolina
    voters filed a similar complaint. The two cases were
    consolidated.
      The plaintiffs challenged the 2016 Plan on multiple
    constitutional grounds. First, they alleged that the Plan
    violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
    Amendment by intentionally diluting the electoral
    strength of Democratic voters. Second, they claimed that
    the Plan violated their First Amendment rights by retali-
    ating against supporters of Democratic candidates on the
    basis of their political beliefs. Third, they asserted that
    the Plan usurped the right of “the People” to elect their
    preferred candidates for Congress, in violation of the
    requirement in Article I, §2, of the Constitution that
    Members of the House of Representatives be chosen “by
    the People of the several States.” Finally, they alleged
    that the Plan violated the Elections Clause by exceeding
    the State’s delegated authority to prescribe the “Times,
    4                RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    Places and Manner of holding Elections” for Members of
    Congress.
       After a four-day trial, the three-judge District Court
    unanimously concluded that the 2016 Plan violated the
    Equal Protection Clause and Article I of the Constitution.
    The court further held, with Judge Osteen dissenting, that

279 F. Supp. 3d 587

    
    
    (MDNC 2018). The defend-
    ants appealed directly to this Court under 

28 U.S. C

    
    
    .
    §1253.
       While that appeal was pending, we decided Gill v. Whit-
    ford, 585 U. S. ___ (2018), a partisan gerrymandering case
    out of Wisconsin. In that case, we held that a plaintiff
    asserting a partisan gerrymandering claim based on a
    theory of vote dilution must establish standing by showing
    he lives in an allegedly “cracked” or “packed” district. Id.,
    at ___ (slip op., at 17). A “cracked” district is one in which
    a party’s supporters are divided among multiple districts,
    so that they fall short of a majority in each; a “packed”
    district is one in which a party’s supporters are highly
    concentrated, so they win that district by a large margin,
    “wasting” many votes that would improve their chances in
    others. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 3–4).
       After deciding Gill, we remanded the present case for
    further consideration by the District Court. 585 U. S. ___
    (2018). On remand, the District Court again struck down
    the 2016 Plan. 

318 F. Supp. 3d 777

    
    
    . It found standing
    and concluded that the case was appropriate for judicial
    resolution. On the merits, the court found that “the Gen-
    eral Assembly’s predominant intent was to discriminate
    against voters who supported or were likely to support
    non-Republican candidates,” and to “entrench Republican
    candidates” through widespread cracking and packing of
    Democratic voters. 

Id., at 883–884.

    
    
    The court rejected the
    defendants’ arguments that the distribution of Republican
    and Democratic voters throughout North Carolina and the

    interest in protecting incumbents neutrally explained the
    2016 Plan’s discriminatory effects. 

Id., at 896–899.

    
    
    In the
    end, the District Court held that 12 of the 13 districts
    constituted partisan gerrymanders that violated the Equal
    Protection Clause. 

Id., at 923.

    
    
       The court also agreed with the plaintiffs that the 2016
    Plan discriminated against them because of their political
    speech and association, in violation of the First Amend-
    ment. 

Id., at 935.

    
    
    Judge Osteen dissented with respect to
    that ruling. 

Id., at 954–955.

    
    
    Finally, the District Court
    concluded that the 2016 Plan violated the Elections Clause
    and Article I, §2. 

Id., at 935–941.

    
    
    The District Court
    enjoined the State from using the 2016 Plan in any elec-
    tion after the November 2018 general election. 

Id., at 942.

    
    
       The defendants again appealed to this Court, and we

      The second case before us is Lamone v. Benisek, No. 18–
    726. In 2011, the Maryland Legislature—dominated by
    Democrats—undertook to redraw the lines of that State’s
    eight congressional districts. The Governor at the time,
    Democrat Martin O’Malley, led the process. He appointed
    a redistricting committee to help redraw the map, and
    asked Congressman Steny Hoyer, who has described
    himself as a “serial gerrymanderer,” to advise the commit-
    tee. 

348 F. Supp. 3d 493

    
    
    , 502 (Md. 2018). The Governor
    later testified that his aim was to “use the redistricting
    process to change the overall composition of Maryland’s
    congressional delegation to 7 Democrats and 1 Republican
    by flipping” one district. 

Ibid. “[A] decision was

    
    
    made to
    go for the Sixth,” ibid., which had been held by a Republi-
    can for nearly two decades. To achieve the required equal
    population among districts, only about 10,000 residents
    needed to be removed from that district. 

Id., at 498.

    
    
    The
    2011 Plan accomplished that by moving roughly 360,000

                         Opinion of the Court
    
    voters out of the Sixth District and moving 350,000 new
    voters in. Overall, the Plan reduced the number of regis-
    tered Republicans in the Sixth District by about 66,000
    and increased the number of registered Democrats by
    about 24,000. 

Id., at 499–501.

    
    
    The map was adopted by a
    party-line vote. 

Id., at 506.

    
    
    It was used in the 2012 elec-
    tion and succeeded in flipping the Sixth District. A Demo-
    crat has held the seat ever since.
       In November 2013, three Maryland voters filed this
    lawsuit. They alleged that the 2011 Plan violated the
    First Amendment, the Elections Clause, and Article I, §2,
    of the Constitution. After considerable procedural skir-
    mishing and litigation over preliminary relief, the District
    Court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs. 

348 F. Supp. 3d 493

    
    
    . It concluded that the plaintiffs’ claims
    were justiciable, and that the Plan violated the First
    Amendment by diminishing their “ability to elect their
    candidate of choice” because of their party affiliation and
    voting history, and by burdening their associational
    rights. 

Id., at 498.

    
    
    On the latter point, the court relied
    upon findings that Republicans in the Sixth District “were
    burdened in fundraising, attracting volunteers, campaign-
    ing, and generating interest in voting in an atmosphere of
    general confusion and apathy.” 

Id., at 524.

    
    
       The District Court permanently enjoined the State from
    using the 2011 Plan and ordered it to promptly adopt a
    new plan for the 2020 election. 

Id., at 525.

       Partisan gerrymandering is nothing new. Nor is frus-
    tration with it. The practice was known in the Colonies
    prior to Independence, and the Framers were familiar
    with it at the time of the drafting and ratification of the
    Constitution. See

    (plurality opin-
    ion). During the very first congressional elections, George
    Washington and his Federalist allies accused Patrick
    Henry of trying to gerrymander Virginia’s districts against
    their candidates—in particular James Madison, who
    ultimately prevailed over fellow future President James
    Monroe. Hunter, The First Gerrymander? 9 Early Am.
    Studies 792–794, 811 (2011). See 5 Writings of Thomas
    Jefferson 71 (P. Ford ed. 1895) (Letter to W. Short (Feb. 9,
    1789)) (“Henry has so modelled the districts for represent-
    atives as to tack Orange [county] to counties where he
    himself has great influence that Madison may not be
    elected into the lower federal house”).
       In 1812, Governor of Massachusetts and future Vice
    President Elbridge Gerry notoriously approved congres-
    sional districts that the legislature had drawn to aid the
    Democratic-Republican Party. The moniker “gerryman-
    der” was born when an outraged Federalist newspaper
    observed that one of the misshapen districts resembled a
    salamander. See

    (plurality opin-
    ion); E. Griffith, The Rise and Development of the Gerry-
    mander 17–19 (1907). “By 1840, the gerrymander was a
    recognized force in party politics and was generally at-
    tempted in all legislation enacted for the formation of
    election districts. It was generally conceded that each
    party would attempt to gain power which was not propor-
    tionate to its numerical strength.”

       The Framers addressed the election of Representatives
    to Congress in the Elections Clause. Art. I, §4, cl. 1. That
    provision assigns to state legislatures the power to pre-
    scribe the “Times, Places and Manner of holding Elec-
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           9

    tions” for Members of Congress, while giving Congress the
    power to “make or alter” any such regulations. Whether to
    give that supervisory authority to the National Govern-
    ment was debated at the Constitutional Convention.
    When those opposed to such congressional oversight
    moved to strike the relevant language, Madison came to
    its defense:
        “[T]he State Legislatures will sometimes fail or refuse
        to consult the common interest at the expense of their
        local coveniency or prejudices. . . . Whenever the
        State Legislatures had a favorite measure to carry,
        they would take care so to mould their regulations as
        to favor the candidates they wished to succeed.” 2
        Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, at 240–
        241.
       During the subsequent fight for ratification, the provi-
    sion remained a subject of debate. Antifederalists predicted
    that Congress’s power under the Elections Clause would
    allow Congress to make itself “omnipotent,” setting the
    “time” of elections as never or the “place” in difficult to
    reach corners of the State. Federalists responded that,
    among other justifications, the revisionary power was
    necessary to counter state legislatures set on undermining
    fair representation, including through malapportionment.
    M. Klarman, The Framers’ Coup: The Making of the United
    States Constitution 340–342 (2016). The Federalists were,
    for example, concerned that newly developing population
    centers would be deprived of their proper electoral weight,
    as some cities had been in Great Britain. See 6 The Doc-
    umentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution:
    Massachusetts 1278–1279 (J. Kaminski & G. Saladino
    eds. 2000).
       Congress has regularly exercised its Elections Clause
    power, including to address partisan gerrymandering.

    (plurality

    1870, enacting the first comprehensive federal statute
    dealing with elections as a way to enforce the Fifteenth
    Amendment. Force Act of 1870, ch. 114, 16 Stat. 140.
    Starting in the 1950s, Congress enacted a series of laws to
    protect the right to vote through measures such as the
    suspension of literacy tests and the prohibition of English-
    only elections. See, e.g., 5

2 U.S. C

    
    
    . §10101 et seq.
      Appellants suggest that, through the Elections Clause,
    the Framers set aside electoral issues such as the one
    before us as questions that only Congress can resolve. See
    

Baker, [369 U.S., at 217](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    . We do not agree. In two areas—
    one-person, one-vote and racial gerrymandering—our
    cases have held that there is a role for the courts with
    respect to at least some issues that could arise from a
    State’s drawing of congressional districts. See Wesberry v.
    Sanders, 

[376 U.S. 1 ](/opinion/106739/wesberry-v-sanders/)

    
    
    (1964); Shaw v. Reno, 

[509 U.S. 630 ](/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/)

    
    
    (1993) (Shaw I ).
      But the history is not irrelevant. The Framers were
    aware of electoral districting problems and considered
    what to do about them. They settled on a characteristic
    approach, assigning the issue to the state legislatures,
    expressly checked and balanced by the Federal Congress.
    As Alexander Hamilton explained, “it will . . . not be de-
    nied that a discretionary power over elections ought to
    exist somewhere. It will, I presume, be as readily conceded
    that there were only three ways in which this power could
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)          11
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    have been reasonably modified and disposed: that it must
    either have been lodged wholly in the national legislature,
    or wholly in the State legislatures, or primarily in the
    latter, and ultimately in the former.” The Federalist No.
    59, p. 362 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). At no point was there a
    suggestion that the federal courts had a role to play. Nor
    was there any indication that the Framers had ever heard
    of courts doing such a thing.
                                  C
      Courts have nevertheless been called upon to resolve a
    variety of questions surrounding districting. Early on,
    doubts were raised about the competence of the federal
    courts to resolve those questions. See Wood v. Broom, 

[287 U.S. 1 ](/opinion/101952/wood-v-broom/)

    
    
    (1932); Colegrove v. Green, 

[328 U.S. 549 ](/opinion/104311/colegrove-v-green/)

    
    
    (1946).
      In the leading case of Baker v. Carr, voters in Tennessee
    complained that the State’s districting plan for state
    representatives “debase[d]” their votes, because the plan
    was predicated on a 60-year-old census that no longer
    reflected the distribution of population in the State. The
    plaintiffs argued that votes of people in overpopulated
    districts held less value than those of people in less-
    populated districts, and that this inequality violated the
    Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
    The District Court dismissed the action on the ground that
    the claim was not justiciable, relying on this Court’s prec-
    edents, including Colegrove. Baker v. Carr, 

[179 F. Supp. 824](/opinion/1522687/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    , 825, 826 (MD Tenn. 1959). This Court reversed. It
    identified various considerations relevant to determining
    whether a claim is a nonjusticiable political question,
    including whether there is “a lack of judicially discover-
    able and manageable standards for resolving 

it.” [369 U.S., at 217](/opinion/106366/baker-v-carr/)

    
    
    . The Court concluded that the claim of population
    inequality among districts did not fall into that category,
    because such a claim could be decided under basic equal
    protection principles.

    In Wesberry v. Sanders,

                          Opinion of the Court
    
    the Court extended its ruling to malapportionment of
    congressional districts, holding that Article I, §2, required
    that “one man’s vote in a congressional election is to be
    worth as much as 

another’s.” [376 U.S., at 8](/opinion/106739/wesberry-v-sanders/)

    
    
    .
       Another line of challenges to districting plans has fo-
    cused on race. Laws that explicitly discriminate on the
    basis of race, as well as those that are race neutral on
    their face but are unexplainable on grounds other than
    race, are of course presumptively invalid. The Court
    applied those principles to electoral boundaries in Gomil-
    lion v. Lightfoot, concluding that a challenge to an “un-
    couth twenty-eight sided” municipal boundary line that
    excluded black voters from city elections stated a constitu-
    tional claim.

       Partisan gerrymandering claims have proved far more
    difficult to adjudicate. The basic reason is that, while it is
    illegal for a jurisdiction to depart from the one-person,
    one-vote rule, or to engage in racial discrimination in
    districting, “a jurisdiction may engage in constitutional
    political gerrymandering.” Hunt v. Cromartie,

       To hold that legislators cannot take partisan interests
    into account when drawing district lines would essentially
    countermand the Framers’ decision to entrust districting
    to political entities. The “central problem” is not deter-

       We first considered a partisan gerrymandering claim in
    Gaffney v. Cummings in 1973. There we rejected an equal
    protection challenge to Connecticut’s redistricting plan,
    which “aimed at a rough scheme of proportional represen-
    tation of the two major political parties” by “wiggl[ing] and
    joggl[ing] boundary lines” to create the appropriate num-

    A majority of the Court agreed that the case was justicia-

    apply. Four Justices would have required proof of “inten-

       In considering whether partisan gerrymandering claims
    are justiciable, we are mindful of Justice Kennedy’s coun-
    sel in Vieth: Any standard for resolving such claims must
    be grounded in a “limited and precise rationale” and be
    “clear, manageable, and politically 

neutral.” [541 U.S., at 306](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    –308 (opinion concurring in judgment). An important
    reason for those careful constraints is that, as a Justice
    with extensive experience in state and local politics put it,
    “[t]he opportunity to control the drawing of electoral
    boundaries through the legislative process of apportion-
    ment is a critical and traditional part of politics in the
    United States.”

       Partisan gerrymandering claims rest on an instinct that
    groups with a certain level of political support should
    enjoy a commensurate level of political power and influ-
    ence. Explicitly or implicitly, a districting map is alleged
    to be unconstitutional because it makes it too difficult for
    one party to translate statewide support into seats in the
    legislature. But such a claim is based on a “norm that
    does not exist” in our electoral system—“statewide elec-
    tions for representatives along party lines.” 

Bandemer, [478 U.S., at 159 ](/opinion/111737/davis-v-bandemer/)

    
    
    (opinion of O’Connor, J.).
       Partisan gerrymandering claims invariably sound in a
    desire for proportional representation.           As Justice
    O’Connor put it, such claims are based on “a conviction
    that the greater the departure from proportionality, the
    more suspect an apportionment plan becomes.” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/111737/davis-v-bandemer/) “Our cases, however,

    
    
    clearly foreclose any claim that the
    Constitution requires proportional representation or that
    legislatures in reapportioning must draw district lines to
    come as near as possible to allocating seats to the contend-
    ing parties in proportion to what their anticipated
    statewide vote will be.”

    Amendment does not require proportional representation

       The Founders certainly did not think proportional rep-
    resentation was required. For more than 50 years after
    ratification of the Constitution, many States elected their
    congressional representatives through at-large or “general
    ticket” elections. Such States typically sent single-party
    delegations to Congress. See E. Engstrom, Partisan Gerry-
    mandering and the Construction of American Democracy

    43–51 (2013). That meant that a party could garner nearly
    half of the vote statewide and wind up without any seats
    in the congressional delegation. The Whigs in Alabama
    suffered that fate in 1840: “their party garnered 43 per-
    cent of the statewide vote, yet did not receive a single
    seat.” 

Id., at 48.

    
    
    When Congress required single-member
    districts in the Apportionment Act of 1842, it was not
    out of a general sense of fairness, but instead a
    (mis)calculation by the Whigs that such a change would
    improve their electoral prospects. 

Id., at 43–44.

    
    
       Unable to claim that the Constitution requires propor-
    tional representation outright, plaintiffs inevitably ask the
    courts to make their own political judgment about how
    much representation particular political parties deserve—
    based on the votes of their supporters—and to rearrange
    the challenged districts to achieve that end. But federal
    courts are not equipped to apportion political power as a
    matter of fairness, nor is there any basis for concluding
    that they were authorized to do so. As Justice Scalia put
    it for the plurality in Vieth:
        “ ‘Fairness’ does not seem to us a judicially manage-
        able standard. . . . Some criterion more solid and more
        demonstrably met than that seems to us necessary to
        enable the state legislatures to discern the limits of
        their districting discretion, to meaningfully constrain
        the discretion of the courts, and to win public ac-
        ceptance for the courts’ intrusion into a process that is
        the very foundation of democratic 

decisionmaking.” [541 U.S., at 291](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    .
       The initial difficulty in settling on a “clear, manageable
    and politically neutral” test for fairness is that it is not
    even clear what fairness looks like in this context. There
    is a large measure of “unfairness” in any winner-take-all
    system. Fairness may mean a greater number of competi-
    tive districts. Such a claim seeks to undo packing and
    18               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    cracking so that supporters of the disadvantaged party
    have a better shot at electing their preferred candidates.
    But making as many districts as possible more competi-
    tive could be a recipe for disaster for the disadvantaged
    party. As Justice White has pointed out, “[i]f all or most of
    the districts are competitive . . . even a narrow statewide
    preference for either party would produce an overwhelm-
    ing majority for the winning party in the state legisla-
    ture.”

    (plurality opinion).
       On the other hand, perhaps the ultimate objective of a
    “fairer” share of seats in the congressional delegation is
    most readily achieved by yielding to the gravitational pull
    of proportionality and engaging in cracking and packing,
    to ensure each party its “appropriate” share of “safe” seats.

    (“To draw district lines to maximize
    the representation of each major party would require
    creating as many safe seats for each party as the demo-
    graphic and predicted political characteristics of the State
    would permit.”);

    –738. Such an
    approach, however, comes at the expense of competitive
    districts and of individuals in districts allocated to the
    opposing party.
       Or perhaps fairness should be measured by adherence
    to “traditional” districting criteria, such as maintaining
    political subdivisions, keeping communities of interest
    together, and protecting incumbents. See Brief for Bipar-
    tisan Group of Current and Former Members of the House
    of Representatives as Amici Curiae; Brief for Professor
    Wesley Pegden et al. as Amici Curiae in No. 18–422. But
    protecting incumbents, for example, enshrines a particular
    partisan distribution. And the “natural political geogra-
    phy” of a State—such as the fact that urban electoral
    districts are often dominated by one political party—can
    itself lead to inherently packed districts. As Justice Ken-
    nedy has explained, traditional criteria such as compact-
    ness and contiguity “cannot promise political neutrality

                         Opinion of the Court
    
    when used as the basis for relief. Instead, it seems, a
    decision under these standards would unavoidably have
    significant political effect, whether intended or not.”

    (plurality opinion) (“[P]acking and
    cracking, whether intentional or no, are quite consistent
    with adherence to compactness and respect for political
    subdivision lines”).
      Deciding among just these different visions of fairness
    (you can imagine many others) poses basic questions that
    are political, not legal. There are no legal standards dis-
    cernible in the Constitution for making such judgments,
    let alone limited and precise standards that are clear,
    manageable, and politically neutral. Any judicial decision
    on what is “fair” in this context would be an “unmoored
    determination” of the sort characteristic of a political
    question beyond the competence of the federal courts.

566 U.S. 189

    
    
    , 196 (2012).
      And it is only after determining how to define fairness
    that you can even begin to answer the determinative
    question: “How much is too much?” At what point does
    permissible partisanship become unconstitutional?        If
    compliance with traditional districting criteria is the
    fairness touchstone, for example, how much deviation
    from those criteria is constitutionally acceptable and how
    should mapdrawers prioritize competing criteria? Should
    a court “reverse gerrymander” other parts of a State to
    counteract “natural” gerrymandering caused, for example,
    by the urban concentration of one party? If a districting
    plan protected half of the incumbents but redistricted the
    rest into head to head races, would that be constitutional?
    A court would have to rank the relative importance of
    those traditional criteria and weigh how much deviation
    from each to allow.
      If a court instead focused on the respective number of
    seats in the legislature, it would have to decide the ideal
    20               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    number of seats for each party and determine at what
    point deviation from that balance went too far. If a 5–3
    allocation corresponds most closely to statewide vote
    totals, is a 6–2 allocation permissible, given that legisla-
    tures have the authority to engage in a certain degree of
    partisan gerrymandering? Which seats should be packed
    and which cracked? Or if the goal is as many competitive
    districts as possible, how close does the split need to be for
    the district to be considered competitive? Presumably not
    all districts could qualify, so how to choose? Even assum-
    ing the court knew which version of fairness to be looking
    for, there are no discernible and manageable standards for
    deciding whether there has been a violation. The ques-
    tions are “unguided and ill suited to the development of
    judicial standards,”

    (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
       Appellees contend that if we can adjudicate one-person,
    one-vote claims, we can also assess partisan gerrymander-
    ing claims. But the one-person, one-vote rule is relatively
    easy to administer as a matter of math. The same cannot
    be said of partisan gerrymandering claims, because the
    Constitution supplies no objective measure for assessing
    whether a districting map treats a political party fairly. It
    hardly follows from the principle that each person must
    have an equal say in the election of representatives that a
    person is entitled to have his political party achieve repre-
    sentation in some way commensurate to its share of
    statewide support.
       More fundamentally, “vote dilution” in the one-person,
    one-vote cases refers to the idea that each vote must carry
    equal weight. In other words, each representative must be
    accountable to (approximately) the same number of con-
    stituents. That requirement does not extend to political
    parties. It does not mean that each party must be influen-

       Nor do our racial gerrymandering cases provide an
    appropriate standard for assessing partisan gerrymander-

    racial gerrymandering claim does not ask for a fair share
    of political power and influence, with all the justiciability

    meets the need for a limited and precise standard that is
    judicially discernible and manageable. And none provides
    a solid grounding for judges to take the extraordinary step
    of reallocating power and influence between political
    parties.

       The Common Cause District Court concluded that all
    but one of the districts in North Carolina’s 2016 Plan
    violated the Equal Protection Clause by intentionally
    diluting the voting strength of Democrats.

    , at 923. In reaching that result the court first required
    the plaintiffs to prove “that a legislative mapdrawer’s
    predominant purpose in drawing the lines of a particular
    district was to ‘subordinate adherents of one political
    party and entrench a rival party in power.’ ”

    (quoting Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent
    Redistricting Comm’n, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op.,
    at 1)). The District Court next required a showing “that
    the dilution of the votes of supporters of a disfavored party
    in a particular district—by virtue of cracking or packing—
    is likely to persist in subsequent elections such that an
    elected representative from the favored party in the dis-
    trict will not feel a need to be responsive to constituents
    who support the disfavored party.” 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at
    867. Finally, after a prima facie showing of partisan vote
    dilution, the District Court shifted the burden to the de-
    fendants to prove that the discriminatory effects are “at-
    tributable to a legitimate state interest or other neutral
    explanation.” 

Id., at 868.

    
    
       The District Court’s “predominant intent” prong is
    borrowed from the racial gerrymandering context. In
    racial gerrymandering cases, we rely on a “predominant

    intent” inquiry to determine whether race was, in fact, the
    reason particular district boundaries were drawn the way
    they were. If district lines were drawn for the purpose of
    separating racial groups, then they are subject to strict
    scrutiny because “race-based decisionmaking is inherently
    suspect.”

    (principal opinion). But determining that lines were
    drawn on the basis of partisanship does not indicate that
    the districting was improper. A permissible intent—
    securing partisan advantage—does not become constitu-
    tionally impermissible, like racial discrimination, when
    that permissible intent “predominates.”
        The District Court tried to limit the reach of its test by
    requiring plaintiffs to show, in addition to predominant
    partisan intent, that vote dilution “is likely to persist” to
    such a degree that the elected representative will feel free
    to ignore the concerns of the supporters of the minority
    party.

    courts to strike down apportionment plans on the basis of
    their prognostications as to the outcome of future elections

    (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (“[W]e are wary of

    state of affairs.”). And the test adopted by the Common
    Cause court requires a far more nuanced prediction than
    simply who would prevail in future political contests.
    Judges must forecast with unspecified certainty whether a
    prospective winner will have a margin of victory sufficient
    to permit him to ignore the supporters of his defeated
    opponent (whoever that may turn out to be). Judges not
    only have to pick the winner—they have to beat the point
    spread.

    , at 885. Experience proves
    that accurately predicting electoral outcomes is not so
    simple, either because the plans are based on flawed
    assumptions about voter preferences and behavior or
    because demographics and priorities change over time. In
    our two leading partisan gerrymandering cases them-
    selves, the predictions of durability proved to be dramati-
    cally wrong. In 1981, Republicans controlled both houses
    of the Indiana Legislature as well as the governorship.
    Democrats challenged the state legislature districting map
    enacted by the Republicans. This Court in Bandemer
    rejected that challenge, and just months later the Demo-
    crats increased their share of House seats in the 1986
    elections. Two years later the House was split 50–50
    between Democrats and Republicans, and the Democrats
    took control of the chamber in 1990. Democrats also
    challenged the Pennsylvania congressional districting
    plan at issue in Vieth. Two years after that challenge
    failed, they gained four seats in the delegation, going from
    a 12–7 minority to an 11–8 majority. At the next election,
    they flipped another Republican seat.
       Even the most sophisticated districting maps cannot
    reliably account for some of the reasons voters prefer one
    candidate over another, or why their preferences may
    change. Voters elect individual candidates in individual
    districts, and their selections depend on the issues that
    matter to them, the quality of the candidates, the tone of
    the candidates’ campaigns, the performance of an incum-
    bent, national events or local issues that drive voter turn-
    out, and other considerations. Many voters split their
    tickets. Others never register with a political party, and
    vote for candidates from both major parties at different

    points during their lifetimes. For all of those reasons,
    asking judges to predict how a particular districting map
    will perform in future elections risks basing constitutional
    holdings on unstable ground outside judicial expertise.
      It is hard to see what the District Court’s third prong—
    providing the defendant an opportunity to show that the
    discriminatory effects were due to a “legitimate redistrict-
    ing objective”—adds to the inquiry. 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at
    861. The first prong already requires the plaintiff to prove
    that partisan advantage predominates. Asking whether a
    legitimate purpose other than partisanship was the moti-
    vation for a particular districting map just restates the
    question.
                                  B
       The District Courts also found partisan gerrymandering
    claims justiciable under the First Amendment, coalescing
    around a basic three-part test: proof of intent to burden
    individuals based on their voting history or party affilia-
    tion; an actual burden on political speech or associational
    rights; and a causal link between the invidious intent and
    actual burden. See Common Cause,

    , at
    929; 

Benisek, 348 F. Supp. 3d, at 522

    
    
    . Both District
    Courts concluded that the districting plans at issue violated
    the plaintiffs’ First Amendment right to association. The
    District Court in North Carolina relied on testimony that,
    after the 2016 Plan was put in place, the plaintiffs faced
    “difficulty raising money, attracting candidates, and mobi-
    lizing voters to support the political causes and issues
    such Plaintiffs sought to advance.” 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at
    932. Similarly, the District Court in Maryland examined
    testimony that “revealed a lack of enthusiasm, indiffer-
    ence to voting, a sense of disenfranchisement, a sense of
    disconnection, and confusion,” and concluded that Repub-
    licans in the Sixth District “were burdened in fundraising,
    attracting volunteers, campaigning, and generating inter-
    26               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE

    est in 

voting.” 348 F. Supp. 3d, at 523

    
    
    –524.
       To begin, there are no restrictions on speech, associa-
    tion, or any other First Amendment activities in the dis-
    tricting plans at issue. The plaintiffs are free to engage in
    those activities no matter what the effect of a plan may be
    on their district.
       The plaintiffs’ argument is that partisanship in district-
    ing should be regarded as simple discrimination against
    supporters of the opposing party on the basis of political
    viewpoint. Under that theory, any level of partisanship in
    districting would constitute an infringement of their First
    Amendment rights. But as the Court has explained, “[i]t
    would be idle . . . to contend that any political considera-
    tion taken into account in fashioning a reapportionment
    plan is sufficient to invalidate it.” 

Gaffney, [412 U.S., at 752](/opinion/108825/gaffney-v-cummings/)

    
    
    . The First Amendment test simply describes the act
    of districting for partisan advantage. It provides no
    standard for determining when partisan activity goes too
    far.
       As for actual burden, the slight anecdotal evidence
    found sufficient by the District Courts in these cases
    shows that this too is not a serious standard for separating
    constitutional from unconstitutional partisan gerryman-
    dering. The District Courts relied on testimony about
    difficulty drumming up volunteers and enthusiasm. How
    much of a decline in voter engagement is enough to consti-
    tute a First Amendment burden? How many door knocks
    must go unanswered? How many petitions unsigned?
    How many calls for volunteers unheeded? The Common
    Cause District Court held that a partisan gerrymander
    places an unconstitutional burden on speech if it has more
    than a “de minimis” “chilling effect or adverse impact” on
    any First Amendment activity. 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 930.
    The court went on to rule that there would be an adverse
    effect “even if the speech of [the plaintiffs] was not in fact
    chilled”; it was enough that the districting plan “makes it
                      Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           27

    their votes into seats,” thereby “enhanc[ing] the[ir] rela-
    tive voice.”

    (internal quotation marks omitted).
       These cases involve blatant examples of partisanship
    driving districting decisions. But the First Amendment
    analysis below offers no “clear” and “manageable” way of
    distinguishing permissible from impermissible partisan
    motivation. The Common Cause court embraced that
    conclusion, observing that “a judicially manageable
    framework for evaluating partisan gerrymandering claims
    need not distinguish an ‘acceptable’ level of partisan ger-
    rymandering from ‘excessive’ partisan gerrymandering”
    because “the Constitution does not authorize state redis-
    tricting bodies to engage in such partisan gerrymander-
    ing.” 

Id., at 851.

    
    
    The decisions below prove the prediction
    of the Vieth plurality that “a First Amendment claim, if it
    were sustained, would render unlawful all consideration of
    political affiliation in 

districting,” [541 U.S., at 294](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    , con-
    trary to our established precedent.
                                  C
      The dissent proposes using a State’s own districting
    criteria as a neutral baseline from which to measure how
    extreme a partisan gerrymander is. The dissent would
    have us line up all the possible maps drawn using those
    criteria according to the partisan distribution they would
    produce. Distance from the “median” map would indicate
    whether a particular districting plan harms supporters of
    one party to an unconstitutional extent. Post, at 18–19, 25
    (opinion of KAGAN, J.).
      As an initial matter, it does not make sense to use crite-
    ria that will vary from State to State and year to year as
    the baseline for determining whether a gerrymander
    violates the Federal Constitution. The degree of partisan
    advantage that the Constitution tolerates should not turn
    on criteria offered by the gerrymanderers themselves. It
    28               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    is easy to imagine how different criteria could move the
    median map toward different partisan distributions. As a
    result, the same map could be constitutional or not de-
    pending solely on what the mapmakers said they set out to
    do. That possibility illustrates that the dissent’s proposed
    constitutional test is indeterminate and arbitrary.
       Even if we were to accept the dissent’s proposed base-
    line, it would return us to “the original unanswerable
    question (How much political motivation and effect is too
    much?).”

    –297 (plurality opinion).
    Would twenty percent away from the median map be
    okay? Forty percent? Sixty percent? Why or why not?
    (We appreciate that the dissent finds all the unanswerable
    questions annoying, see post, at 22, but it seems a useful
    way to make the point.) The dissent’s answer says it all:
    “This much is too much.” Post, at 25–26. That is not even
    trying to articulate a standard or rule.
       The dissent argues that there are other instances in law
    where matters of degree are left to the courts. See post, at
    27. True enough. But those instances typically involve
    constitutional or statutory provisions or common law
    confining and guiding the exercise of judicial discretion.
    For example, the dissent cites the need to determine “sub-
    stantial anticompetitive effect[s]” in antitrust law. Post,
    at 27 (citing Ohio v. American Express Co., 585 U. S. ___
    (2018)). That language, however, grew out of the Sherman
    Act, understood from the beginning to have its “origin in
    the common law” and to be “familiar in the law of this
    country prior to and at the time of the adoption of the
    [A]ct.” Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. United States, 

221 U.S. 1

    
    
    , 51 (1911). Judges began with a significant body of
    law about what constituted a legal violation. In other
    cases, the pertinent statutory terms draw meaning from
    related provisions or statutory context. Here, on the other
    hand, the Constitution provides no basis whatever to
    guide the exercise of judicial discretion. Common experi-

    ence gives content to terms such as “substantial risk” or
    “substantial harm,” but the same cannot be said of sub-
    stantial deviation from a median map. There is no way to
    tell whether the prohibited deviation from that map
    should kick in at 25 percent or 75 percent or some other
    point. The only provision in the Constitution that specifi-
    cally addresses the matter assigns it to the political
    branches. See Art. I, §4, cl. 1.
                                  D
       The North Carolina District Court further concluded
    that the 2016 Plan violated the Elections Clause and
    Article I, §2. We are unconvinced by that novel approach.
       Article I, §2, provides that “[t]he House of Representa-
    tives shall be composed of Members chosen every second
    Year by the People of the several States.” The Elections
    Clause provides that “[t]he Times, Places and Manner of
    holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall
    be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but
    the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such
    Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.”
    Art. I, §4, cl. 1.
       The District Court concluded that the 2016 Plan exceeded
    the North Carolina General Assembly’s Elections Clause
    authority because, among other reasons, “the Elections
    Clause did not empower State legislatures to disfavor the
    interests of supporters of a particular candidate or party
    in drawing congressional districts.” 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    infringes the right of “the People” to select their repre-
    sentatives. 

Id., at 938–940.

    
    
    Before the District Court’s
    decision, no court had reached a similar conclusion. In
    fact, the plurality in Vieth concluded—without objection
    from any other Justice—that neither §2 nor §4 of Article I
    “provides a judicially enforceable limit on the political
    considerations that the States and Congress may take into
    30               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE

    .
      The District Court nevertheless asserted that partisan
    gerrymanders violate “the core principle of [our] republi-
    can government” preserved in Art. I, §2, “namely, that the
    voters should choose their representatives, not the other
    way around.”

    , at 940 (quoting Arizona
    State Legislature, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 35); inter-
    nal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). That
    seems like an objection more properly grounded in the
    Guarantee Clause of Article IV, §4, which “guarantee[s] to
    every State in [the] Union a Republican Form of Govern-
    ment.” This Court has several times concluded, however,
    that the Guarantee Clause does not provide the basis for a
    justiciable claim. See, e.g., Pacific States Telephone &
    Telegraph Co. v. Oregon,

      Excessive partisanship in districting leads to results
    that reasonably seem unjust. But the fact that such ger-
    rymandering is “incompatible with democratic principles,”
    Arizona State Legislature, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1),
    does not mean that the solution lies with the federal judi-
    ciary. We conclude that partisan gerrymandering claims
    present political questions beyond the reach of the federal
    courts. Federal judges have no license to reallocate politi-
    cal power between the two major political parties, with no
    plausible grant of authority in the Constitution, and no
    legal standards to limit and direct their decisions.
    “[J]udicial action must be governed by standard, by rule,”
    and must be “principled, rational, and based upon rea-
    soned distinctions” found in the Constitution or laws.

    , 279 (plurality opinion). Judicial
    review of partisan gerrymandering does not meet those
    basic requirements.
      Today the dissent essentially embraces the argument
    that the Court unanimously rejected in Gill: “this Court
                      Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           31
    
                          Opinion of the Court
    
    can address the problem of partisan gerrymandering
    because it must.” 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). That is
    not the test of our authority under the Constitution; that
    document instead “confines the federal courts to a properly
    judicial role.” Town of Chester v. Laroe Estates, Inc., 581
    U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 4).
       What the appellees and dissent seek is an unprecedented
    expansion of judicial power. We have never struck down a
    partisan gerrymander as unconstitutional—despite vari-
    ous requests over the past 45 years. The expansion of
    judicial authority would not be into just any area of con-
    troversy, but into one of the most intensely partisan as-
    pects of American political life. That intervention would
    be unlimited in scope and duration—it would recur over
    and over again around the country with each new round of
    districting, for state as well as federal representatives.
    Consideration of the impact of today’s ruling on democratic
    principles cannot ignore the effect of the unelected and
    politically unaccountable branch of the Federal Govern-
    ment assuming such an extraordinary and unprecedented
    role. See post, at 32–33.
       Our conclusion does not condone excessive partisan
    gerrymandering. Nor does our conclusion condemn com-
    plaints about districting to echo into a void. The States,
    for example, are actively addressing the issue on a number
    of fronts. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Florida struck
    down that State’s congressional districting plan as a viola-
    tion of the Fair Districts Amendment to the Florida Con-
    stitution. League of Women Voters of Florida v. Detzner,
    

172 So. 3d 363

    
    
    (2015). The dissent wonders why we can’t
    do the same. See post, at 31. The answer is that there is
    no “Fair Districts Amendment” to the Federal Constitu-
    tion. Provisions in state statutes and state constitutions
    can provide standards and guidance for state courts to
    apply. (We do not understand how the dissent can main-
    tain that a provision saying that no districting plan “shall
    32               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    be drawn with the intent to favor or disfavor a political
    party” provides little guidance on the question. See post,
    at 31, n. 6.) Indeed, numerous other States are restricting
    partisan considerations in districting through legislation.
    One way they are doing so is by placing power to draw
    electoral districts in the hands of independent commis-
    sions. For example, in November 2018, voters in Colorado
    and Michigan approved constitutional amendments creat-
    ing multimember commissions that will be responsible in
    whole or in part for creating and approving district maps
    for congressional and state legislative districts. See Colo.
    Const., Art. V, §§44, 46; Mich. Const., Art. IV, §6. Mis-
    souri is trying a different tack. Voters there overwhelm-
    ingly approved the creation of a new position—state de-
    mographer—to draw state legislative district lines. Mo.
    Const., Art. III, §3.
       Other States have mandated at least some of the tradi-
    tional districting criteria for their mapmakers. Some have
    outright prohibited partisan favoritism in redistricting.
    See Fla. Const., Art. III, §20(a) (“No apportionment plan
    or individual district shall be drawn with the intent to

    Clause. The first bill introduced in the 116th Congress
    would require States to create 15-member independent
    commissions to draw congressional districts and would
    establish certain redistricting criteria, including protec-
    tion for communities of interest, and ban partisan gerry-
    mandering. H. R. 1, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., §§2401, 2411
    (2019).
       Dozens of other bills have been introduced to limit
    reliance on political considerations in redistricting. In
    2010, H. R. 6250 would have required States to follow
    standards of compactness, contiguity, and respect for
    political subdivisions in redistricting. It also would have
    prohibited the establishment of congressional districts
    “with the major purpose of diluting the voting strength of
    any person, or group, including any political party,” except
    when necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act of
    1965. H. R. 6250, 111th Cong., 2d Sess., §2 (referred to
    committee).
       Another example is the Fairness and Independence in
    Redistricting Act, which was introduced in 2005 and has
    been reintroduced in every Congress since. That bill
    would require every State to establish an independent
    commission to adopt redistricting plans. The bill also set
    forth criteria for the independent commissions to use, such
    as compactness, contiguity, and population equality. It
    would prohibit consideration of voting history, political
    party affiliation, or incumbent Representative’s residence.
    H. R. 2642, 109th Cong., 1st Sess., §4 (referred to
    subcommittee).
       We express no view on any of these pending proposals.
    We simply note that the avenue for reform established by
    the Framers, and used by Congress in the past, remains
    open.

    the reach of its competence. But we have no commission
    to allocate political power and influence in the absence of a

    the exercise of such authority. “It is emphatically the

      JUSTICE    KAGAN, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,
    JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR join,
    dissenting.
      For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a
    constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond
    judicial capabilities.
      And not just any constitutional violation. The partisan
    gerrymanders in these cases deprived citizens of the most
    fundamental of their constitutional rights: the rights to
    participate equally in the political process, to join with
    others to advance political beliefs, and to choose their
    political representatives. In so doing, the partisan gerry-
    manders here debased and dishonored our democracy,
    turning upside-down the core American idea that all
    governmental power derives from the people. These ger-
    rymanders enabled politicians to entrench themselves in
    office as against voters’ preferences. They promoted parti-
    2                RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    sanship above respect for the popular will. They encour-
    aged a politics of polarization and dysfunction. If left
    unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irrepa-
    rably damage our system of government.
       And checking them is not beyond the courts. The major-
    ity’s abdication comes just when courts across the country,
    including those below, have coalesced around manageable
    judicial standards to resolve partisan gerrymandering
    claims.    Those standards satisfy the majority’s own
    benchmarks. They do not require—indeed, they do not
    permit—courts to rely on their own ideas of electoral
    fairness, whether proportional representation or any
    other. And they limit courts to correcting only egregious
    gerrymanders, so judges do not become omnipresent play-
    ers in the political process. But yes, the standards used
    here do allow—as well they should—judicial intervention
    in the worst-of-the-worst cases of democratic subversion,
    causing blatant constitutional harms. In other words,
    they allow courts to undo partisan gerrymanders of the
    kind we face today from North Carolina and Maryland. In
    giving such gerrymanders a pass from judicial review, the
    majority goes tragically wrong.
                                   I
      Maybe the majority errs in these cases because it pays
    so little attention to the constitutional harms at their core.
    After dutifully reciting each case’s facts, the majority
    leaves them forever behind, instead immersing itself in
    everything that could conceivably go amiss if courts be-
    came involved. So it is necessary to fill in the gaps. To
    recount exactly what politicians in North Carolina and
    Maryland did to entrench their parties in political office,
    whatever the electorate might think. And to elaborate on
    the constitutional injury those politicians wreaked, to our
    democratic system and to individuals’ rights. All that will
    help in considering whether courts confronting partisan
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           3

    gerrymandering claims are really so hamstrung—so un-
    able to carry out their constitutional duties—as the major-
    ity thinks.
                                  A
       The plaintiffs here challenge two congressional district-
    ing plans—one adopted by Republicans in North Carolina
    and the other by Democrats in Maryland—as unconstitu-
    tional partisan gerrymanders. As I relate what happened
    in those two States, ask yourself: Is this how American
    democracy is supposed to work?
       Start with North Carolina. After the 2010 census, the
    North Carolina General Assembly, with Republican major-
    ities in both its House and its Senate, enacted a new con-
    gressional districting plan. That plan governed the two
    next national elections. In 2012, Republican candidates
    won 9 of the State’s 13 seats in the U. S. House of Repre-
    sentatives, although they received only 49% of the
    statewide vote. In 2014, Republican candidates increased
    their total to 10 of the 13 seats, this time based on 55% of
    the vote. Soon afterward, a District Court struck down
    two districts in the plan as unconstitutional racial gerry-
    manders. See Harris v. McCrory, 

159 F. Supp. 3d 600

    
    
    (MDNC 2016), aff ’d sub nom. Cooper v. Harris, 581 U. S.
    ___ (2017). The General Assembly, with both chambers
    still controlled by Republicans, went back to the drawing
    board to craft the needed remedial state map. And here is
    how the process unfolded:
    
        The Republican co-chairs of the Assembly’s redis-
         tricting committee, Rep. David Lewis and Sen.
         Robert Rucho, instructed Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a
         Republican districting specialist, to create a new
         map that would maintain the 10–3 composition of
         the State’s congressional delegation come what
         might. Using sophisticated technological tools and
    4                RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
           precinct-level election results selected to predict
           voting behavior, Hofeller drew district lines to min-
           imize Democrats’ voting strength and ensure the
           election of 10 Republican Congressmen. See Com-
           mon Cause v. Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d 777

    
    
    , 805–806
           (MDNC 2018).
    
         Lewis then presented for the redistricting commit-
          tee’s (retroactive) approval a list of the criteria Ho-
          feller had employed—including one labeled “Parti-
          san Advantage.” That criterion, endorsed by a
          party-line vote, stated that the committee would
          make all “reasonable efforts to construct districts”
          to “maintain the current [10–3] partisan makeup”
          of the State’s congressional delegation. 

Id., at 807.

    
    
         Lewis explained the Partisan Advantage criterion to
          legislators as follows: We are “draw[ing] the maps
          to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and
          3 Democrats because [I] d[o] not believe it[’s] possi-
          ble to draw a map with 11 Republicans and 2 Dem-
          ocrats.” 

Id., at 808

    
    
    (internal quotation marks
          omitted).
    
         The committee and the General Assembly later en-
          acted, again on a party-line vote, the map Hofeller
          had drawn. See 

id., at 809.

    
    
         Lewis announced: “I think electing Republicans is
          better than electing Democrats. So I drew this map
          to help foster what I think is better for the coun-
          try.” 

Ibid. (internal quotation marks

    
    
    omitted).
    
    You might think that judgment best left to the American
    people. But give Lewis credit for this much: The map has
    worked just as he planned and predicted. In 2016, Repub-
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           5

    lican congressional candidates won 10 of North Carolina’s
    13 seats, with 53% of the statewide vote. Two years later,
    Republican candidates won 9 of 12 seats though they
    received only 50% of the vote. (The 13th seat has not yet
    been filled because fraud tainted the initial election.)
       Events in Maryland make for a similarly grisly tale.
    For 50 years, Maryland’s 8-person congressional delega-
    tion typically consisted of 2 or 3 Republicans and 5 or 6
    Democrats. After the 2000 districting, for example, the
    First and Sixth Districts reliably elected Republicans, and
    the other districts as reliably elected Democrats. See R.
    Cohen & J. Barnes, Almanac of American Politics 2016, p.
    836 (2015). But in the 2010 districting cycle, the State’s
    Democratic leaders, who controlled the governorship and
    both houses of the General Assembly, decided to press
    their advantage.
    
        Governor Martin O’Malley, who oversaw the pro-
         cess, decided (in his own later words) “to create a
         map that was more favorable for Democrats over
         the next ten years.” Because flipping the First Dis-
         trict was geographically next-to-impossible, “a deci-
         sion was made to go for the Sixth.” Benisek v. La-
         mone, 

348 F. Supp. 3d 493

    
    
    , 502 (Md. 2018) (quoting
         O’Malley; emphasis deleted).
    
        O’Malley appointed an advisory committee as the
         public face of his effort, while asking Congressman
         Steny Hoyer, a self-described “serial gerryman-
         derer,” to hire and direct a mapmaker.

         Hoyer retained Eric Hawkins, an analyst at a polit-
         ical consulting firm providing services to Demo-
         crats. See 

id., at 502–503.

    
    
        Hawkins received only two instructions: to ensure
         that the new map produced 7 reliable Democratic
    6                RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                        KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
           seats, and to protect all Democratic incumbents.
           See 

id., at 503.

    
    
         Using similar technologies and election data as Ho-
          feller, Hawkins produced a map to those specifica-
          tions. Although new census figures required re-
          moving only 10,000 residents from the Sixth
          District, Hawkins proposed a large-scale population
          transfer. The map moved about 360,000 voters out
          of the district and another 350,000 in. That swap
          decreased the number of registered Republicans in
          the district by over 66,000 and increased the num-
          ber of registered Democrats by about 24,000, all to
          produce a safe Democratic district. See 

id., at 499,

    
    
          501.
    
         After the advisory committee adopted the map on a
          party-line vote, State Senate President Thomas
          Miller briefed the General Assembly’s Democratic
          caucuses about the new map’s aims. Miller told his
          colleagues that the map would give “Democrats a
          real opportunity to pick up a seventh seat in the
          delegation” and that “[i]n the face of Republican
          gains in redistricting in other states[,] we have a
          serious obligation to create this opportunity.”

          line vote. See 

id., at 506.

    
    
    Maryland’s Democrats proved no less successful than
    North Carolina’s Republicans in devising a voter-proof
    map. In the four elections that followed (from 2012
    through 2018), Democrats have never received more than
    65% of the statewide congressional vote. Yet in each of
    those elections, Democrats have won (you guessed it) 7 of 8

    District.
                                  B
       Now back to the question I asked before: Is that how
    American democracy is supposed to work? I have yet to
    meet the person who thinks so.
       “Governments,” the Declaration of Independence states,
    “deriv[e] their just Powers from the Consent of the Gov-
    erned.” The Constitution begins: “We the People of the
    United States.” The Gettysburg Address (almost) ends:
    “[G]overnment of the people, by the people, for the people.”
    If there is a single idea that made our Nation (and that
    our Nation commended to the world), it is this one: The
    people are sovereign. The “power,” James Madison wrote,
    “is in the people over the Government, and not in the
    Government over the people.” 4 Annals of Cong. 934
    (1794).
       Free and fair and periodic elections are the key to that
    vision. The people get to choose their representatives.
    And then they get to decide, at regular intervals, whether
    to keep them. Madison again: “[R]epublican liberty” de-
    mands “not only, that all power should be derived from the
    people; but that those entrusted with it should be kept in
    dependence on the people.” 2 The Federalist No. 37, p. 4
    (J. & A. McLean eds. 1788). Members of the House of
    Representatives, in particular, are supposed to “recollect[ ]
    [that] dependence” every day. 

Id., No. 57,

    
    
    at 155. To
    retain an “intimate sympathy with the people,” they must
    be “compelled to anticipate the moment” when their “exer-
    cise of [power] is to be reviewed.” 

Id., Nos. 52,

    
    
    57, at 124,
    155. Election day—next year, and two years later, and
    two years after that—is what links the people to their
    representatives, and gives the people their sovereign
    power.     That day is the foundation of democratic
    governance.

       And partisan gerrymandering can make it meaningless.
    At its most extreme—as in North Carolina and Mary-
    land—the practice amounts to “rigging elections.” Vieth v.
    Jubelirer, 

[541 U.S. 267](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    , 317 (2004) (Kennedy, J., concur-
    ring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted). By
    drawing districts to maximize the power of some voters
    and minimize the power of others, a party in office at the
    right time can entrench itself there for a decade or more,
    no matter what the voters would prefer. Just ask the
    people of North Carolina and Maryland. The “core princi-
    ple of republican government,” this Court has recognized,
    is “that the voters should choose their representatives, not
    the other way around.” Arizona State Legislature v. Ari-
    zona Independent Redistricting Comm’n, 576 U. S. ___, ___
    (2015) (slip op., at 35) (internal quotation marks omitted).
    Partisan gerrymandering turns it the other way around.
    By that mechanism, politicians can cherry-pick voters to
    ensure their reelection. And the power becomes, as Madi-
    son put it, “in the Government over the people.” 4 Annals
    of Cong. 934.
       The majority disputes none of this. I think it important
    to underscore that fact: The majority disputes none of
    what I have said (or will say) about how gerrymanders
    undermine democracy. Indeed, the majority concedes
    (really, how could it not?) that gerrymandering is “incom-
    patible with democratic principles.” Ante, at 30 (quoting
    Arizona State Legislature, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1)).
    And therefore what? That recognition would seem to
    demand a response. The majority offers two ideas that
    might qualify as such. One is that the political process
    can deal with the problem—a proposition so dubious on its
    face that I feel secure in delaying my answer for some
    time. See ante, at 31–33; infra, at 29–31. The other is
    that political gerrymanders have always been with us.
    See ante, at 8, 24. To its credit, the majority does not
    frame that point as an originalist constitutional argument.
                         Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                    9
    
                             KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    After all (as the majority rightly notes), racial and resi-
    dential gerrymanders were also once with us, but the
    Court has done something about that fact. See ante, at
    10.1 The majority’s idea instead seems to be that if we
    have lived with partisan gerrymanders so long, we will
    survive.
      That complacency has no cause. Yes, partisan gerry-
    mandering goes back to the Republic’s earliest days. (As
    does vociferous opposition to it.) But big data and modern
    technology—of just the kind that the mapmakers in North
    Carolina and Maryland used—make today’s gerrymander-
    ing altogether different from the crude linedrawing of the
    past. Old-time efforts, based on little more than guesses,
    sometimes       led    to     so-called    dummymanders—
    gerrymanders that went spectacularly wrong. Not likely
    in today’s world. Mapmakers now have access to more
    granular data about party preference and voting behavior
    than ever before. County-level voting data has given way
    to precinct-level or city-block-level data; and increasingly,
    mapmakers avail themselves of data sets providing wide-
    ranging information about even individual voters. See
    Brief for Political Science Professors as Amici Curiae 20–
    22. Just as important, advancements in computing tech-
    nology have enabled mapmakers to put that information
    to use with unprecedented efficiency and precision. See
    

id., at 22–25.

    
    
    While bygone mapmakers may have drafted
    three or four alternative districting plans, today’s map-
    makers can generate thousands of possibilities at the
    touch of a key—and then choose the one giving their party
    maximum advantage (usually while still meeting tradi-

      1 And even putting that aside, any originalist argument would have
    
    to deal with an inconvenient fact. The Framers originally viewed
    political parties themselves (let alone their most partisan actions) with
    deep suspicion, as fomenters of factionalism and “symptom[s] of disease
    in the body politic.” G. Wood, Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early
    Republic, 1789–1815, p. 140 (2009).

    tional districting requirements). The effect is to make
    gerrymanders far more effective and durable than before,
    insulating politicians against all but the most titanic
    shifts in the political tides. These are not your grand-
    father’s—let alone the Framers’—gerrymanders.
       The proof is in the 2010 pudding. That redistricting
    cycle produced some of the most extreme partisan gerry-
    manders in this country’s history. I’ve already recounted
    the results from North Carolina and Maryland, and you’ll
    hear even more about those.

    19–20. But the voters in those States were not the only
    ones to fall prey to such districting perversions. Take
    Pennsylvania. In the three congressional elections occur-
    ring under the State’s original districting plan (before the
    State Supreme Court struck it down), Democrats received
    between 45% and 51% of the statewide vote, but won only
    5 of 18 House seats. See League of Women Voters v. Penn-
    sylvania, ___ Pa. ___, ___, 

178 A.3d 737

    
    
    , 764 (2018). Or go
    next door to Ohio. There, in four congressional elections,
    Democrats tallied between 39% and 47% of the statewide
    vote, but never won more than 4 of 16 House seats. See
    Ohio A. Philip Randolph Inst. v. Householder, 

373 F. Supp. 3d 978

    
    
    , 1074 (SD Ohio 2019). (Nor is there any
    reason to think that the results in those States stemmed
    from political geography or non-partisan districting crite-
    ria, rather than from partisan manipulation. See infra, at
    15, 31.) And gerrymanders will only get worse (or depend-
    ing on your perspective, better) as time goes on—as data
    becomes ever more fine-grained and data analysis tech-
    niques continue to improve. What was possible with paper
    and pen—or even with Windows 95—doesn’t hold a candle
    (or an LED bulb?) to what will become possible with de-
    velopments like machine learning. And someplace along
    this road, “we the people” become sovereign no longer.

       Partisan gerrymandering of the kind before us not only
    subverts democracy (as if that weren’t bad enough). It
    violates individuals’ constitutional rights as well. That
    statement is not the lonesome cry of a dissenting Justice.
    This Court has recognized extreme partisan gerrymander-
    ing as such a violation for many years.
       Partisan gerrymandering operates through vote dilu-
    tion—the devaluation of one citizen’s vote as compared to
    others. A mapmaker draws district lines to “pack” and
    “crack” voters likely to support the disfavored party. See
    generally Gill v. Whitford, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018)
    (slip op., at 14–16). He packs supermajorities of those
    voters into a relatively few districts, in numbers far greater
    than needed for their preferred candidates to prevail.
    Then he cracks the rest across many more districts,
    spreading them so thin that their candidates will not be
    able to win. Whether the person is packed or cracked, his
    vote carries less weight—has less consequence—than it
    would under a neutrally drawn (non-partisan) map. See
    id., at ___ (KAGAN, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4). In short,
    the mapmaker has made some votes count for less, be-
    cause they are likely to go for the other party.
       That practice implicates the Fourteenth Amendment’s
    Equal Protection Clause. The Fourteenth Amendment, we
    long ago recognized, “guarantees the opportunity for equal
    participation by all voters in the election” of legislators.

[377 U.S. 533](/opinion/106850/reynolds-v-sims/)

    
    
    , 566 (1964). And that
    opportunity “can be denied by a debasement or dilution of
    the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly
    prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” 

[Id., at 555\. ](/opinion/106850/reynolds-v-sims/)

    
    
    Based on that principle, this Court in its one-person-
    one-vote decisions prohibited creating districts with signif-
    icantly different populations. A State could not, we ex-
    plained, thus “dilut[e] the weight of votes because of place
    of residence.”

    partisan gerrymandering case is much the same, except
    that the dilution is based on party affiliation. In such a
    case, too, the districters have set out to reduce the weight
    of certain citizens’ votes, and thereby deprive them of their
    capacity to “full[y] and effective[ly] participat[e] in the
    political process[ ].”

    As Justice Kennedy (in a
    controlling opinion) once hypothesized: If districters de-
    clared that they were drawing a map “so as most to bur-
    den [the votes of] Party X’s” supporters, it would violate
    the Equal Protection Clause.

    . For
    (in the language of the one-person-one-vote decisions) it
    would infringe those voters’ rights to “equal [electoral]
    participation.”

    ‘we the people’ under the Constitution visualizes no pre-
    ferred class of voters but equality among those who meet
    the basic qualifications”).
       And partisan gerrymandering implicates the First
    Amendment too. That Amendment gives its greatest
    protection to political beliefs, speech, and association. Yet
    partisan gerrymanders subject certain voters to “disfa-
    vored treatment”—again, counting their votes for less—
    precisely because of “their voting history [and] their ex-
    pression of political views.”

    (opin-

    harm is an associational one. Representative democracy is
    “unimaginable without the ability of citizens to band
    together in [support of] candidates who espouse their
    political views.” California Democratic Party v. Jones, 

[530 U.S. 567](/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/)

    
    
    , 574 (2000). By diluting the votes of certain
    citizens, the State frustrates their efforts to translate
    those affiliations into political effectiveness. See Gill, 585
    U. S., at ___ (KAGAN, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9) (“Mem-

    quotation marks omitted).
       Though different Justices have described the constitu-
    tional harm in diverse ways, nearly all have agreed on this
    much: Extreme partisan gerrymandering (as happened in
    North Carolina and Maryland) violates the Constitution.

    again, the majority never disagrees; it appears to accept
    the “principle that each person must have an equal say in
    the election of representatives.” Ante, at 20. And indeed,
    without this settled and shared understanding that cases
    like these inflict constitutional injury, the question of
    whether there are judicially manageable standards for
    resolving them would never come up.
                               II
      So the only way to understand the majority’s opinion is
    as follows: In the face of grievous harm to democratic
    14              RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE

    governance and flagrant infringements on individuals’
    rights—in the face of escalating partisan manipulation
    whose compatibility with this Nation’s values and law no
    one defends—the majority declines to provide any remedy.
    For the first time in this Nation’s history, the majority
    declares that it can do nothing about an acknowledged
    constitutional violation because it has searched high and
    low and cannot find a workable legal standard to apply.
       The majority gives two reasons for thinking that the
    adjudication of partisan gerrymandering claims is beyond
    judicial capabilities. First and foremost, the majority
    says, it cannot find a neutral baseline—one not based on
    contestable notions of political fairness—from which to
    measure injury. See ante, at 15–19. According to the
    majority, “[p]artisan gerrymandering claims invariably
    sound in a desire for proportional representation.” Ante,
    at 16. But the Constitution does not mandate proportional
    representation. So, the majority contends, resolving those
    claims “inevitably” would require courts to decide what is
    “fair” in the context of districting. Ante, at 17. They
    would have “to make their own political judgment about
    how much representation particular political parties
    deserve” and “to rearrange the challenged districts to
    achieve that end.” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/111737/davis-v-bandemer/) (emphasis in original).

    
    
    And sec-
    ond, the majority argues that even after establishing a
    baseline, a court would have no way to answer “the deter-
    minative question: ‘How much is too much?’ ” Ante, at 19.
    No “discernible and manageable” standard is available,
    the majority claims—and so courts could willy-nilly be-
    come embroiled in fixing every districting plan. Ante, at
    20; see ante, at 15–16.
       I’ll give the majority this one—and important—thing: It
    identifies some dangers everyone should want to avoid.
    Judges should not be apportioning political power based
    on their own vision of electoral fairness, whether propor-
    tional representation or any other. And judges should not
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           15
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    be striking down maps left, right, and center, on the view
    that every smidgen of politics is a smidgen too much.
    Respect for state legislative processes—and restraint in
    the exercise of judicial authority—counsels intervention in
    only egregious cases.
       But in throwing up its hands, the majority misses some-
    thing under its nose: What it says can’t be done has been
    done. Over the past several years, federal courts across
    the country—including, but not exclusively, in the deci-
    sions below—have largely converged on a standard for
    adjudicating partisan gerrymandering claims (striking
    down both Democratic and Republican districting plans in
    the process). See also Ohio A. Philip Randolph Inst., 

373 F. Supp. 3d 978

    
    
    ; League of Women Voters of Michigan v.
    Benson, 

373 F. Supp. 3d 867

    
    
    (ED Mich. 2019). And that
    standard does what the majority says is impossible. The
    standard does not use any judge-made conception of elec-
    toral fairness—either proportional representation or any
    other; instead, it takes as its baseline a State’s own crite-
    ria of fairness, apart from partisan gain. And by requiring
    plaintiffs to make difficult showings relating to both pur-
    pose and effects, the standard invalidates the most ex-
    treme, but only the most extreme, partisan gerrymanders.
       Below, I first explain the framework courts have devel-
    oped, and describe its application in these two cases.
    Doing so reveals in even starker detail than before how
    much these partisan gerrymanders deviated from demo-
    cratic norms. As I lay out the lower courts’ analyses, I
    consider two specific criticisms the majority levels—each
    of which reveals a saddening nonchalance about the threat
    such districting poses to self-governance. All of that lays
    the groundwork for then assessing the majority’s more
    general view, described above, that judicial policing in this
    area cannot be either neutral or restrained. The lower
    courts’ reasoning, as I’ll show, proves the opposite.

                                   A
       Start with the standard the lower courts used. The
    majority disaggregates the opinions below, distinguishing
    the one from the other and then chopping up each into “a
    number of ‘tests.’ ” Ante, at 22; see ante, at 22–30. But in
    doing so, it fails to convey the decisions’ most significant—
    and common—features. Both courts focused on the harm
    of vote dilution, 

see supra, at 11

    
    
    , though the North Caro-
    lina court mostly grounded its analysis in the Fourteenth
    Amendment and the Maryland court in the First. And
    both courts (like others around the country) used basically
    the same three-part test to decide whether the plaintiffs
    had made out a vote dilution claim. As many legal stand-
    ards do, that test has three parts: (1) intent; (2) effects;
    and (3) causation. First, the plaintiffs challenging a dis-
    tricting plan must prove that state officials’ “predominant
    purpose” in drawing a district’s lines was to “entrench
    [their party] in power” by diluting the votes of citizens
    favoring its rival. Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 864 (quoting
    Arizona State Legislature, 576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1)).
    Second, the plaintiffs must establish that the lines drawn
    in fact have the intended effect by “substantially” diluting
    their votes. 

Lamone, 348 F. Supp. 3d, at 498

    
    
    . And third,
    if the plaintiffs make those showings, the State must come
    up with a legitimate, non-partisan justification to save its
    map. See Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 867.2 If you are a
    lawyer, you know that this test looks utterly ordinary. It
    is the sort of thing courts work with every day.
       Turn now to the test’s application. First, did the North
    Carolina and Maryland districters have the predominant

    tive explanation for the evidence that the plaintiffs put forward.
    Presumably, both States had trouble coming up with something. Like
    the majority, see ante, at 25, I therefore pass quickly over this part of
    the test.

    purpose of entrenching their own party in power? Here,
    the two District Courts catalogued the overwhelming
    direct evidence that they did. To remind you of some
    highlights, 

see supra, at 4

    
    
    –6: North Carolina’s redistrict-
    ing committee used “Partisan Advantage” as an official
    criterion for drawing district lines. And from the first to
    the last, that committee’s chair (along with his mapmaker)
    acted to ensure a 10–3 partisan split, whatever the
    statewide vote, because he thought that “electing Republi-
    cans is better than electing Democrats.” For their part,
    Maryland’s Democrats—the Governor, senior Congress-
    man, and State Senate President alike—openly admitted
    to a single driving purpose: flip the Sixth District from
    Republican to Democratic. They did not blanch from
    moving some 700,000 voters into new districts (when one-
    person-one-vote rules required relocating just 10,000) for
    that reason and that reason alone.
       The majority’s response to the District Courts’ purpose
    analysis is discomfiting. The majority does not contest the
    lower courts’ findings; how could it? Instead, the majority
    says that state officials’ intent to entrench their party in
    power is perfectly “permissible,” even when it is the pre-
    dominant factor in drawing district lines. Ante, at 23. But
    that is wrong. True enough, that the intent to inject “po-
    litical considerations” into districting may not raise any
    constitutional concerns. In Gaffney v. Cummings, 

[412 U.S. 735 ](/opinion/108825/gaffney-v-cummings/)

    
    
    (1973), for example, we thought it non-
    problematic when state officials used political data to
    ensure rough proportional representation between the two
    parties. And true enough that even the naked purpose to
    gain partisan advantage may not rise to the level of consti-
    tutional notice when it is not the driving force in mapmak-
    ing or when the intended gain is slight. See 

Vieth, [541 U.S., at 286 ](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    (plurality opinion). But when political actors
    have a specific and predominant intent to entrench them-
    selves in power by manipulating district lines, that goes
    18               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    too far. Consider again Justice Kennedy’s hypothetical of
    mapmakers who set out to maximally burden (i.e., make
    count for as little as possible) the votes going to a rival
    party. 

See supra, at 12

    
    
    . Does the majority really think
    that goal is permissible? But why even bother with hypo-
    theticals? Just consider the purposes here. It cannot be
    permissible and thus irrelevant, as the majority claims,
    that state officials have as their purpose the kind of gro-
    tesquely gerrymandered map that, according to all this
    Court has ever said, violates the Constitution. 

See supra, at 13

    
    
    .
       On to the second step of the analysis, where the plain-
    tiffs must prove that the districting plan substantially
    dilutes their votes. The majority fails to discuss most of
    the evidence the District Courts relied on to find that the
    plaintiffs had done so. See ante, at 23–24. But that evi-
    dence—particularly from North Carolina—is the key to
    understanding both the problem these cases present and
    the solution to it they offer. The evidence reveals just how
    bad the two gerrymanders were (in case you had any
    doubts). And it shows how the same technologies and data
    that today facilitate extreme partisan gerrymanders also
    enable courts to discover them, by exposing just how much
    they dilute votes. See 

Vieth, [541 U.S., at 312](/opinion/134735/vieth-v-jubelirer/)

    
    
    –313 (opin-
    ion of Kennedy, J.) (predicting that development).
       Consider the sort of evidence used in North Carolina
    first. There, the plaintiffs demonstrated the districting
    plan’s effects mostly by relying on what might be called
    the “extreme outlier approach.” (Here’s a spoiler: the
    State’s plan was one.) The approach—which also has
    recently been used in Michigan and Ohio litigation—
    begins by using advanced computing technology to ran-
    domly generate a large collection of districting plans that
    incorporate the State’s physical and political geography
    and meet its declared districting criteria, except for parti-
    san gain. For each of those maps, the method then uses
                         Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)                    19

    actual precinct-level votes from past elections to determine
    a partisan outcome (i.e., the number of Democratic and
    Republican seats that map produces). Suppose we now
    have 1,000 maps, each with a partisan outcome attached
    to it. We can line up those maps on a continuum—the
    most favorable to Republicans on one end, the most favor-
    able to Democrats on the other.3 We can then find the
    median outcome—that is, the outcome smack dab in the
    center—in a world with no partisan manipulation. And
    we can see where the State’s actual plan falls on the spec-
    trum—at or near the median or way out on one of the
    tails? The further out on the tail, the more extreme the
    partisan distortion and the more significant the vote
    dilution. See generally Brief for Eric S. Lander as Amicus
    Curiae 7–22.
      Using that approach, the North Carolina plaintiffs
    offered a boatload of alternative districting plans—all
    showing that the State’s map was an out-out-out-outlier.
    One expert produced 3,000 maps, adhering in the way
    described above to the districting criteria that the North
    Carolina redistricting committee had used, other than
    partisan advantage. To calculate the partisan outcome of
    those maps, the expert also used the same election data (a
    composite of seven elections) that Hofeller had employed
    when devising the North Carolina plan in the first in-
    stance. The results were, shall we say, striking. Every
    single one of the 3,000 maps would have produced at least
    one more Democratic House Member than the State’s
    actual map, and 77% would have elected three or four
    more. See Rucho,

      3 As I’ll discuss later, this distribution of outcomes provides what the
    
    majority says does not exist—a neutral comparator for the State’s own
    plan. See ante, at

    ; infra, at 22–25. It essentially
    answers the question: In a State with these geographic features and
    this distribution of voters and this set of districting criteria—but
    without partisan manipulation—what would happen?

    276. A second expert obtained essentially the same re-
    sults with maps conforming to more generic districting
    criteria (e.g., compactness and contiguity of districts).
    Over 99% of that expert’s 24,518 simulations would have
    led to the election of at least one more Democrat, and over
    70% would have led to two or three more. See Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 893–894. Based on those and other find-
    ings, the District Court determined that the North Caro-
    lina plan substantially dilutes the plaintiffs’ votes.4
       Because the Maryland gerrymander involved just one
    district, the evidence in that case was far simpler—but no
    less powerful for that. You’ve heard some of the numbers
    before. 

See supra, at 6

    
    
    . The 2010 census required only a
    minimal change in the Sixth District’s population—the
    subtraction of about 10,000 residents from more than
    700,000. But instead of making a correspondingly mini-
    mal adjustment, Democratic officials reconfigured the
    entire district. They moved 360,000 residents out and
    another 350,000 in, while splitting some counties for the
    first time in almost two centuries. The upshot was a
    district with 66,000 fewer Republican voters and 24,000
    more Democratic ones. In the old Sixth, 47% of registered
    voters were Republicans and only 36% Democrats. But in
    the new Sixth, 44% of registered voters were Democrats
    and only 33% Republicans. That reversal of the district’s
    partisan composition translated into four consecutive
    Democratic victories, including in a wave election year for
    ——————
      4 The District Court also relied on actual election results (under both
    
    the new plan and the similar one preceding it) and on mathematical
    measurements of the new plan’s “partisan asymmetry.” See Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 884–895. Those calculations assess whether supporters
    of the two parties can translate their votes into representation with
    equal ease. See Stephanopoulos & McGhee, The Measure of a Metric,
    70 Stan. L. Rev. 1503, 1505–1507 (2018). The court found that the new
    North Carolina plan led to extreme asymmetry, compared both to plans
    used in the rest of the country and to plans previously used in the
    State. See Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    Republicans (2014). In what was once a party stronghold,
    Republicans now have little or no chance to elect their
    preferred candidate. The District Court thus found that
    the gerrymandered Maryland map substantially dilutes
    Republicans’ votes. See

      The majority claims all these findings are mere “prog-
    nostications” about the future, in which no one “can have
    any confidence.” Ante, at 23 (internal quotation marks
    omitted). But the courts below did not gaze into crystal
    balls, as the majority tries to suggest. Their findings
    about these gerrymanders’ effects on voters—both in the
    past and predictably in the future—were evidence-based,
    data-based, statistics-based. Knowledge-based, one might
    say. The courts did what anyone would want a deci-
    sionmaker to do when so much hangs in the balance.
    They looked hard at the facts, and they went where the
    facts led them. They availed themselves of all the infor-
    mation that mapmakers (like Hofeller and Hawkins) and
    politicians (like Lewis and O’Malley) work so hard to
    amass and then use to make every districting decision.
    They refused to content themselves with unsupported and
    out-of-date musings about the unpredictability of the
    American voter. See ante, at 24–25; but see Brief for
    Political Science Professors as Amici Curiae 14–20 (citing
    chapter and verse to the contrary). They did not bet
    America’s future—as today the majority does—on the idea
    that maps constructed with so much expertise and care to
    make electoral outcomes impervious to voting would
    somehow or other come apart. They looked at the evi-
    dence—at the facts about how these districts operated—
    and they could reach only one conclusion. By substantially
    diluting the votes of citizens favoring their rivals, the
    politicians of one party had succeeded in entrenching
    themselves in office. They had beat democracy.

                                   B
       The majority’s broadest claim, as I’ve noted, is that this
    is a price we must pay because judicial oversight of parti-
    san gerrymandering cannot be “politically neutral” or
    “manageable.” Ante, at 19; 

see supra, at 14

    
    
    . Courts, the
    majority argues, will have to choose among contested
    notions of electoral fairness. (Should they take as the
    ideal mode of districting proportional representation,
    many competitive seats, adherence to traditional district-
    ing criteria, or so forth?) See ante, at 16–19. And even
    once courts have chosen, the majority continues, they will
    have to decide “[h]ow much is too much?”—that is, how
    much deviation from the chosen “touchstone” to allow?
    Ante, at 19–20. In answering that question, the majority
    surmises, they will likely go far too far. See ante, at 15.
    So the whole thing is impossible, the majority concludes.
    To prove its point, the majority throws a bevy of question
    marks on the page. (I count nine in just two paragraphs.
    See ante, at 19–20.) But it never tries to analyze the
    serious question presented here—whether the kind of
    standard developed below falls prey to those objections, or
    instead allows for neutral and manageable oversight. The
    answer, as you’ve already heard enough to know, is the
    latter. That kind of oversight is not only possible; it’s been
    done.
       Consider neutrality first. Contrary to the majority’s
    suggestion, the District Courts did not have to—and in
    fact did not—choose among competing visions of electoral
    fairness. That is because they did not try to compare the
    State’s actual map to an “ideally fair” one (whether based
    on proportional representation or some other criterion).
    Instead, they looked at the difference between what the
    State did and what the State would have done if politi-
    cians hadn’t been intent on partisan gain. Or put differ-
    ently, the comparator (or baseline or touchstone) is the
    result not of a judge’s philosophizing but of the State’s own

    characteristics and judgments. The effects evidence in
    these cases accepted as a given the State’s physical geog-
    raphy (e.g., where does the Chesapeake run?) and political
    geography (e.g., where do the Democrats live on top of
    each other?). So the courts did not, in the majority’s
    words, try to “counteract ‘natural’ gerrymandering caused,
    for example, by the urban concentration of one party.”
    Ante, at 19. Still more, the courts’ analyses used the
    State’s own criteria for electoral fairness—except for
    naked partisan gain. Under their approach, in other
    words, the State selected its own fairness baseline in the
    form of its other districting criteria. All the courts did was
    determine how far the State had gone off that track be-
    cause of its politicians’ effort to entrench themselves in
    office.
       The North Carolina litigation well illustrates the point.
    The thousands of randomly generated maps I’ve men-
    tioned formed the core of the plaintiffs’ case that the North
    Carolina plan was an “extreme[ ] outlier.” Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 852 (internal quotation marks omitted); 

see supra, at 18

    
    
    –20. Those maps took the State’s political
    landscape as a given. In North Carolina, for example,
    Democratic voters are highly concentrated in cities. That
    fact was built into all the maps; it became part of the
    baseline. See Rucho, 

318 F. Supp. 3d

    
    
    , at 896–897. On top
    of that, the maps took the State’s legal landscape as a
    given. They incorporated the State’s districting priorities,
    excluding partisanship. So in North Carolina, for exam-
    ple, all the maps adhered to the traditional criteria of
    contiguity and compactness. 

See supra, at 19

    
    
    –20. But the
    comparator maps in another State would have incorpo-
    rated different objectives—say, the emphasis Arizona
    places on competitive districts or the requirement Iowa
    imposes that counties remain whole. See Brief for Math-
    ematicians et al. as Amici Curiae 19–20. The point is that
    the assemblage of maps, reflecting the characteristics and
    24               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    judgments of the State itself, creates a neutral baseline
    from which to assess whether partisanship has run amok.
    Extreme outlier as to what? As to the other maps the
    State could have produced given its unique political geog-
    raphy and its chosen districting criteria. Not as to the
    maps a judge, with his own view of electoral fairness,
    could have dreamed up.
       The Maryland court lacked North Carolina’s fancy
    evidence, but analyzed the gerrymander’s effects in much
    the same way—not as against an ideal goal, but as against
    an ex ante baseline. To see the difference, shift gears for a
    moment and compare Maryland and Massachusetts—both
    of which (aside from Maryland’s partisan gerrymander)
    use traditional districting criteria. In those two States
    alike, Republicans receive about 35% of the vote in
    statewide elections. See Almanac of American Politics
    2016, at 836, 880. But the political geography of the
    States differs. In Massachusetts, the Republican vote is
    spread evenly across the State; because that is so, district-
    ing plans (using traditional criteria of contiguity and
    compactness) consistently lead to an all-Democratic con-
    gressional delegation. By contrast, in Maryland, Republi-
    cans are clumped—into the Eastern Shore (the First Dis-
    trict) and the Northwest Corner (the old Sixth). Claims of
    partisan gerrymandering in those two States could come
    out the same way if judges, à la the majority, used their
    own visions of fairness to police districting plans; a judge
    in each State could then insist, in line with proportional
    representation, that 35% of the vote share entitles citizens
    to around that much of the delegation. But those suits
    would not come out the same if courts instead asked: What
    would have happened, given the State’s natural political
    geography and chosen districting criteria, had officials not
    indulged in partisan manipulation? And that is what the
    District Court in Maryland inquired into. The court did
    not strike down the new Sixth District because a judicial
                     Cite as: 588 U. S. ____ (2019)           25
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    ideal of proportional representation commanded another
    Republican seat. It invalidated that district because the
    quest for partisan gain made the State override its own
    political geography and districting criteria. So much,
    then, for the impossibility of neutrality.
       The majority’s sole response misses the point. Accord-
    ing to the majority, “it does not make sense to use” a
    State’s own (non-partisan) districting criteria as the base-
    line from which to measure partisan gerrymandering
    because those criteria “will vary from State to State and
    year to year.” Ante, at 27. But that is a virtue, not a
    vice—a feature, not a bug. Using the criteria the State
    itself has chosen at the relevant time prevents any judicial
    predilections from affecting the analysis—exactly what the
    majority claims it wants. At the same time, using those
    criteria enables a court to measure just what it should: the
    extent to which the pursuit of partisan advantage—by
    these legislators at this moment—has distorted the State’s
    districting decisions. Sure, different non-partisan criteria
    could result, as the majority notes, in different partisan
    distributions to serve as the baseline. Ante, at 28. But
    that in itself raises no issue: Everyone agrees that state
    officials using non-partisan criteria (e.g., must counties be
    kept together? should districts be compact?) have wide
    latitude in districting. The problem arises only when
    legislators or mapmakers substantially deviate from the
    baseline distribution by manipulating district lines for
    partisan gain. So once again, the majority’s analysis
    falters because it equates the demand to eliminate parti-
    san gerrymandering with a demand for a single partisan
    distribution—the one reflecting proportional representa-
    tion. See ante, at 16–17. But those two demands are
    different, and only the former is at issue here.
       The majority’s “how much is too much” critique fares no
    better than its neutrality argument. How about the fol-
    lowing for a first-cut answer: This much is too much. By
    26               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE
    
                         KAGAN, J., dissenting
    
    any measure, a map that produces a greater partisan
    skew than any of 3,000 randomly generated maps (all with
    the State’s political geography and districting criteria built
    in) reflects “too much” partisanship. Think about what I
    just said: The absolute worst of 3,001 possible maps. The
    only one that could produce a 10–3 partisan split even as
    Republicans got a bare majority of the statewide vote.
    And again: How much is too much? This much is too
    much: A map that without any evident non-partisan dis-
    tricting reason (to the contrary) shifted the composition of
    a district from 47% Republicans and 36% Democrats to
    33% Republicans and 42% Democrats. A map that in 2011
    was responsible for the largest partisan swing of a con-
    gressional district in the country. See 

Lamone, 348 F. Supp. 3d, at 519

    
    
    . Even the majority acknowledges that
    “[t]hese cases involve blatant examples of partisanship
    driving districting decisions.” Ante, at 27. If the majority
    had done nothing else, it could have set the line here.
    How much is too much? At the least, any gerrymanders as
    bad as these.
       And if the majority thought that approach too case-
    specific, see ante, at 28, it could have used the lower
    courts’ general standard—focusing on “predominant”
    purpose and “substantial” effects—without fear of inde-
    terminacy. I do not take even the majority to claim that
    courts are incapable of investigating whether legislators
    mainly intended to seek partisan advantage. See ante, at
    19–20 (focusing on the difficulty of measuring effects).
    That is for good reason. Although purpose inquiries carry
    certain hazards (which courts must attend to), they are a
    common form of analysis in constitutional cases. See, e.g.,
    Miller v. Johnson, 

[515 U.S. 900](/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/)

    
    
    , 916 (1995); Church of

    Those inquiries would be no harder here than in other
    contexts.

       Nor is there any reason to doubt, as the majority does,
    the competence of courts to determine whether a district
    map “substantially” dilutes the votes of a rival party’s
    supporters from the everything-but-partisanship baseline
    described above. (Most of the majority’s difficulties here
    really come from its idea that ideal visions set the base-
    line. But that is double-counting—and, as already shown,
    wrong to boot.) As this Court recently noted, “the law is
    full of instances” where a judge’s decision rests on “esti-
    mating rightly . . . some matter of degree”—including the
    “substantial[ity]” of risk or harm. Johnson v. United
    States, 576 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12) (internal
    quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Ohio v. American
    Express Co., 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 9) (de-
    termining “substantial anticompetitive effect[s]” when
    applying the Sherman Act); United States v. Davis, ante,
    at 7–10 (KAVANAUGH, J., dissenting) (cataloging countless
    statutes requiring a “substantial” risk of harm). The
    majority is wrong to think that these laws typically (let
    alone uniformly) further “confine[ ] and guide[ ]” judicial
    decisionmaking. Ante, at 28. They do not, either in them-
    selves or through “statutory context.” 

Ibid. To the extent

    
    
    additional guidance has developed over the years (as
    under the Sherman Act), courts themselves have been its
    author—as they could be in this context too. And contrary
    to the majority’s suggestion, see ibid., courts all the time
    make judgments about the substantiality of harm without
    reducing them to particular percentages. If courts are no
    longer competent to do so, they will have to relinquish,
    well, substantial portions of their docket.
       And the combined inquiry used in these cases set the
    bar high, so that courts could intervene in the worst parti-
    san gerrymanders, but no others. Or to say the same
    thing, so that courts could intervene in the kind of ex-
    treme gerrymanders that nearly every Justice for decades
    has thought to violate the Constitution.

    Illicit purpose was simple to show here only because poli-
    ticians and mapmakers thought their actions could not be
    attacked in court. See Rucho,

    felt free to openly proclaim their intent to entrench their
    party in office. 

See supra, at 4

    
    
    –6. But if the Court today
    had declared that behavior justiciable, such smoking guns
    would all but disappear. Even assuming some officials
    continued to try implementing extreme partisan gerry-
    manders,5 they would not brag about their efforts. So
    plaintiffs would have to prove the intent to entrench
    through circumstantial evidence—essentially showing
    that no other explanation (no geographic feature or non-
    partisan districting objective) could explain the districting
    plan’s vote dilutive effects. And that would be impossible
    unless those effects were even more than substantial—
    unless mapmakers had packed and cracked with abandon
    in unprecedented ways. As again, they did here. That the
    two courts below found constitutional violations does not
    mean their tests were unrigorous; it means that the con-
    duct they confronted was constitutionally appalling—by
    even the strictest measure, inordinately partisan.
       The majority, in the end, fails to understand both the
    plaintiffs’ claims and the decisions below. Everything in
    today’s opinion assumes that these cases grew out of a
    “desire for proportional representation” or, more generally
    phrased, a “fair share of political power.” Ante, at 16, 21.
    And everything in it assumes that the courts below had to
    (and did) decide what that fair share would be. But that is
    ——————
      5 A decision of this Court invalidating the North Carolina and Mary-
    
    land gerrymanders would of course have curbed much of that behavior.
    In districting cases no less than others, officials respond to what this
    Court determines the law to sanction. See, e.g., Charles & Fuentes-
    Rohwer, Judicial Intervention as Judicial Restraint, 132 Harv. L. Rev.
    236, 269 (2018) (discussing how the Court’s prohibition of racial gerry-
    manders affected districting).

    not so. The plaintiffs objected to one specific practice—the
    extreme manipulation of district lines for partisan gain.
    Elimination of that practice could have led to proportional
    representation. Or it could have led to nothing close.
    What was left after the practice’s removal could have been
    fair, or could have been unfair, by any number of
    measures. That was not the crux of this suit. The plain-
    tiffs asked only that the courts bar politicians from en-
    trenching themselves in power by diluting the votes of
    their rivals’ supporters. And the courts, using neutral and
    manageable—and eminently legal—standards, provided
    that (and only that) relief. This Court should have
    cheered, not overturned, that restoration of the people’s
    power to vote.
                                  III
       This Court has long understood that it has a special
    responsibility to remedy violations of constitutional rights
    resulting from politicians’ districting decisions. Over 50
    years ago, we committed to providing judicial review in
    that sphere, recognizing as we established the one-person-
    one-vote rule that “our oath and our office require no less.”
    

Reynolds, [377 U.S., at 566](/opinion/106850/reynolds-v-sims/)

    
    
    . Of course, our oath and our
    office require us to vindicate all constitutional rights. But
    the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in cases
    like these. “For here, politicians’ incentives conflict with
    voters’ interests, leaving citizens without any political
    remedy for their constitutional harms.” Gill, 585 U. S., at
    ___ (KAGAN, J., concurring) (slip op., at 14). Those harms
    arise because politicians want to stay in office. No one can
    look to them for effective relief.
       The majority disagrees, concluding its opinion with a
    paean to congressional bills limiting partisan gerryman-
    ders. “Dozens of [those] bills have been introduced,” the
    majority says. Ante, at 33. One was “introduced in 2005
    and has been reintroduced in every Congress since.”

    And might be reintroduced until the end of time. Because
    what all these bills have in common is that they are not
    laws. The politicians who benefit from partisan gerry-
    mandering are unlikely to change partisan gerrymander-
    ing. And because those politicians maintain themselves in
    office through partisan gerrymandering, the chances for
    legislative reform are slight.
       No worries, the majority says; it has another idea. The
    majority notes that voters themselves have recently ap-
    proved ballot initiatives to put power over districting in
    the hands of independent commissions or other non-
    partisan actors. See ante, at 32. Some Members of the
    majority, of course, once thought such initiatives unconsti-
    tutional. See Arizona State Legislature, 576 U. S., at ___
    (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1). But put that
    aside. Fewer than half the States offer voters an oppor-
    tunity to put initiatives to direct vote; in all the rest (in-
    cluding North Carolina and Maryland), voters are depend-
    ent on legislators to make electoral changes (which for all
    the reasons already given, they are unlikely to do). And
    even when voters have a mechanism they can work them-
    selves, legislators often fight their efforts tooth and nail.
    Look at Missouri. There, the majority touts a voter-
    approved proposal to turn districting over to a state de-
    mographer. See ante, at 32. But before the demographer
    had drawn a single line, Members of the state legislature
    had introduced a bill to start undoing the change. See Mo.
    H. J. Res. 48, 100th Gen. Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess. (2019).
    I’d put better odds on that bill’s passage than on all the
    congressional proposals the majority cites.
       The majority’s most perplexing “solution” is to look to
    state courts. Ante, at 30. “[O]ur conclusion,” the majority
    states, does not “condemn complaints about districting to
    echo into a void”: Just a few years back, “the Supreme
    Court of Florida struck down that State’s congressional
    districting plan as a violation” of the State Constitution.

    (2015). And indeed, the majority
    might have added, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
    last year did the same thing. See League of Women Voters,
    ___ Pa., at ___, 178 A. 3d, at 818. But what do those
    courts know that this Court does not? If they can develop
    and apply neutral and manageable standards to identify
    unconstitutional gerrymanders, why couldn’t we?6
       We could have, and we should have. The gerrymanders
    here—and they are typical of many—violated the constitu-
    tional rights of many hundreds of thousands of American
    citizens. Those voters (Republicans in the one case, De-
    mocrats in the other) did not have an equal opportunity to
    participate in the political process. Their votes counted for
    far less than they should have because of their partisan
    affiliation. When faced with such constitutional wrongs,
    courts must intervene: “It is emphatically the province
    and duty of the judicial department to say what the law
    is.” Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803). That
    is what the courts below did. Their decisions are worth a
    read. They (and others that have recently remedied simi-
    lar violations) are detailed, thorough, painstaking. They
    ——————
      6 Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, state courts do not typically
    
    have more specific “standards and guidance” to apply than federal
    courts have. Ante, at 31. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court based its
    gerrymandering decision on a constitutional clause providing only that
    “elections shall be free and equal” and no one shall “interfere to prevent
    the free exercise of the right of suffrage.” League of Women Voters, ___
    Pa., at ___–___, 178 A. 3d, at 803–804 (quoting Pa. Const., Art. I, §5).
    And even the Florida “Free Districts Amendment,” which the majority
    touts, says nothing more than that no districting plan “shall be drawn
    with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party.” Fla. Const., Art.
    III, §20(a). If the majority wants the kind of guidance that will keep
    courts from intervening too far in the political sphere, see ante, at 15,
    that Amendment does not provide it: The standard is in fact a good deal
    less exacting than the one the District Courts below applied. In any
    event, only a few States have a constitutional provision like Florida’s,
    so the majority’s state-court solution does not go far.
    32               RUCHO v. COMMON CAUSE

    evaluated with immense care the factual evidence and
    legal arguments the parties presented. They used neutral
    and manageable and strict standards. They had not a
    shred of politics about them. Contra the majority, see
    ante, at 34, this was law.
      That is not to deny, of course, that these cases have
    great political consequence. They do. Among the amicus
    briefs here is one from a bipartisan group of current and
    former Members of the House of Representatives. They
    describe all the ways partisan gerrymandering harms our
    political system—what they call “a cascade of negative
    results.” Brief as Amicus Curiae 5. These artificially
    drawn districts shift influence from swing voters to party-
    base voters who participate in primaries; make biparti-
    sanship and pragmatic compromise politically difficult or
    impossible; and drive voters away from an ever more
    dysfunctional political process. See 

id., at 5–6.

    
    
    Last year,
    we heard much the same from current and former state
    legislators. In their view, partisan gerrymandering has
    “sounded the death-knell of bipartisanship,” creating a
    legislative environment that is “toxic” and “tribal.” Brief
    as Amicus Curiae in Gill v. Whitford, O. T. 2016, No. 16–
    1161, pp. 6, 25. Gerrymandering, in short, helps create
    the polarized political system so many Americans loathe.
      And gerrymandering is, as so many Justices have em-
    phasized before, anti-democratic in the most profound
    sense.

    –8. In our government, “all political
    power flows from the people.” Arizona State Legislature,
    576 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 35). And that means, as
    Alexander Hamilton once said, “that the people should
    choose whom they please to govern them.” 2 Debates on
    the Constitution 257 (J. Elliot ed. 1891). But in Maryland
    and North Carolina they cannot do so. In Maryland,
    election in and election out, there are 7 Democrats and 1
    Republican in the congressional delegation. In North
    Carolina, however the political winds blow, there are 10

    Republicans and 3 Democrats. Is it conceivable that
    someday voters will be able to break out of that prefabri-
    cated box? Sure. But everything possible has been done
    to make that hard. To create a world in which power does
    not flow from the people because they do not choose their
    governors.
      Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the
    law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in
    these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the
    Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations.
    None is more important than free and fair elections. With
    respect but deep sadness, I dissent.
