    CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR
                     THE SECOND CIRCUIT
    
       No. 17–1702.       Argued February 25, 2019—Decided June 17, 2019
    New York state law requires cable operators to set aside channels on
     their cable systems for public access. Those channels are operated by
     the cable operator unless the local government chooses to itself oper-
     ate the channels or designates a private entity to operate the chan-
     nels. New York City (the City) has designated a private nonprofit
     corporation, petitioner Manhattan Neighborhood Network (MNN), to
     operate the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system in
     Manhattan.      Respondents DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto
     Melendez produced a film critical of MNN to be aired on MNN’s pub-
     lic access channels. MNN televised the film. MNN later suspended
     Halleck and Melendez from all MNN services and facilities. The pro-
     ducers sued, claiming that MNN violated their First Amendment
     free-speech rights when it restricted their access to the public access
     channels because of the content of their film. The District Court
     dismissed the claim on the ground that MNN is not a state actor and
     therefore is not subject to First Amendment constraints on its edito-
     rial discretion. Reversing in relevant part, the Second Circuit con-
     cluded that MNN is a state actor subject to First Amendment con-
     straints.
    Held: MNN is not a state actor subject to the First Amendment. Pp. 5–
     16.
        (a) The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits only
     governmental, not private, abridgment of speech. See, e.g., Denver
     Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 

518 U.S. 727

    
    
    ,
     737. This Court’s state-action doctrine distinguishes the government
     from individuals and private entities. Pp. 5–14.
          (1) A private entity may qualify as a state actor when, as rele-
    2      MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                                      Syllabus
    
        vant here, the entity exercises “powers traditionally exclusively re-
        served to the State.” Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 

[419 U.S. 345](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    , 352. The Court has stressed that “very few” functions fall into
        that category. Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 

[436 U.S. 149](/opinion/109861/flagg-bros-inc-v-brooks/)

    
    
    , 158. The
        relevant function in this case—operation of public access channels on
        a cable system—has not traditionally and exclusively been performed
        by government. Since the 1970s, a variety of private and public ac-
        tors have operated public access channels. Early Manhattan public
        access channels were operated by private cable operators with some
        help from private nonprofit organizations. That practice continued
        until the early 1990s, when MNN began to operate the channels.
        Operating public access channels on a cable system is not a tradi-
        tional, exclusive public function. Pp. 6–8.
             (2) The producers contend that the relevant function here is more
        generally the operation of a public forum for speech, which, they
        claim, is a traditional, exclusive public function. But that analysis
        mistakenly ignores the threshold state-action question. Providing
        some kind of forum for speech is not an activity that only governmen-
        tal entities have traditionally performed. Therefore, a private entity
        who provides a forum for speech is not transformed by that fact alone
        into a state actor. See Hudgens v. NLRB, 

424 U.S. 507

    
    
    , 520–521.
        Pp. 8–10.
             (3) The producers note that the City has designated MNN to op-
        erate the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system, and
        that the State heavily regulates MNN with respect to those channels.
        But the City’s designation is analogous to a government license, a
        government contract, or a government-granted monopoly, none of
        which converts a private entity into a state actor—unless the private
        entity is performing a traditional, exclusive public function. See, e.g.,
        San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm.,
        

[483 U.S. 522](/opinion/111950/san-francisco-arts-athletics-inc-v-united-
states-olympic-comm/)

    
    
    , 543–544. And the fact that MNN is subject to the
        State’s extensive regulation “does not by itself convert its action into
        that of the State.” 

Jackson, [419 U.S., at 350](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    . Pp. 11–14.
           (b) The producers alternatively contend that the public access
        channels are actually the City’s property and that MNN is essentially
        managing government property on the City’s behalf. But the City
        does not own or lease the public access channels and does not possess
        any formal easement or other property interest in the channels. It
        does not matter that a provision in the franchise agreements between
        the City and Time Warner allowed the City to designate a private en-
        tity to operate the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable sys-
        tem. Nothing in the agreements suggests that the City possesses any
        property interest in the cable system or in the public access channels
        on that system. Pp. 14–15.

                                     [June 17, 2019]
    
       JUSTICE KAVANAUGH delivered the opinion of the Court.
       The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment con-
    strains governmental actors and protects private actors.
    To draw the line between governmental and private, this
    Court applies what is known as the state-action doctrine.
    Under that doctrine, as relevant here, a private entity
    may be considered a state actor when it exercises a func-
    tion “traditionally exclusively reserved to the State.”
    Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 

[419 U.S. 345](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    , 352
    (1974).
       This state-action case concerns the public access chan-
    nels on Time Warner’s cable system in Manhattan. Public
    access channels are available for private citizens to use.
    The public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system
    in Manhattan are operated by a private nonprofit corpora-
    tion known as MNN. The question here is whether
    MNN—even though it is a private entity—nonetheless is a
    state actor when it operates the public access channels. In
    other words, is operation of public access channels on a
    cable system a traditional, exclusive public function? If so,
    then the First Amendment would restrict MNN’s exercise
    2   MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    of editorial discretion over the speech and speakers on the
    public access channels.
       Under the state-action doctrine as it has been articulated
    and applied by our precedents, we conclude that opera-
    tion of public access channels on a cable system is not a
    traditional, exclusive public function. Moreover, a private
    entity such as MNN who opens its property for speech by
    others is not transformed by that fact alone into a state
    actor. In operating the public access channels, MNN is a
    private actor, not a state actor, and MNN therefore is not
    subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial
    discretion. We reverse in relevant part the judgment of
    the Second Circuit, and we remand the case for further
    proceedings consistent with this opinion.
                                  I
                                 A
      Since the 1970s, public access channels have been a
    regular feature on cable television systems throughout the
    United States. In the 1970s, Federal Communications
    Commission regulations required certain cable operators
    to set aside channels on their cable systems for public
    access. In 1979, however, this Court ruled that the FCC
    lacked statutory authority to impose that mandate. See
    FCC v. Midwest Video Corp., 

[440 U.S. 689 ](/opinion/110047/fcc-v-midwest-video-corp/)

    
    
    (1979). A few
    years later, Congress passed and President Reagan signed
    the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984. 98 Stat.
    2779. The Act authorized state and local governments to
    require cable operators to set aside channels on their cable
    systems for public access.

    cable systems for public access. 16 N. Y. Codes, Rules &
    Regs. §§895.1(f), 895.4(b) (2018). State law requires that
    use of the public access channels be free of charge and

    first-come, first-served. §§895.4(c)(4) and (6). Under state
    law, the cable operator operates the public access channels
    unless the local government in the area chooses to itself
    operate the channels or designates a private entity to
    operate the channels. §895.4(c)(1).
       Time Warner (now known as Charter) operates a cable
    system in Manhattan. Under state law, Time Warner
    must set aside some channels on its cable system for
    public access. New York City (the City) has designated a
    private nonprofit corporation named Manhattan Neigh-
    borhood Network, commonly referred to as MNN, to oper-
    ate Time Warner’s public access channels in Manhattan.
    This case involves a complaint against MNN regarding its
    management of the public access channels.
                                   B
       Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss, we
    accept the allegations in the complaint as true. See Ash-
    croft v. Iqbal, 

[556 U.S. 662](/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/)

    
    
    , 678 (2009).
       DeeDee Halleck and Jesus Papoleto Melendez produced
    public access programming in Manhattan. They made a
    film about MNN’s alleged neglect of the East Harlem
    community. Halleck submitted the film to MNN for airing
    on MNN’s public access channels, and MNN later tele-
    vised the film. Afterwards, MNN fielded multiple com-
    plaints about the film’s content. In response, MNN tem-
    porarily suspended Halleck from using the public access
    channels.
       Halleck and Melendez soon became embroiled in another
    dispute with MNN staff. In the wake of that dispute,
    MNN ultimately suspended Halleck and Melendez from
    all MNN services and facilities.
       Halleck and Melendez then sued MNN, among other
    parties, in Federal District Court. The two producers
    claimed that MNN violated their First Amendment free-
    speech rights when MNN restricted their access to the
    4   MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    public access channels because of the content of their film.
       MNN moved to dismiss the producers’ First Amendment
    claim on the ground that MNN is not a state actor and
    therefore is not subject to First Amendment restrictions on
    its editorial discretion. The District Court agreed with
    MNN and dismissed the producers’ First Amendment
    claim.
       The Second Circuit reversed in relevant part. 

882 F.3d 300

    
    
    , 308 (2018). In the majority opinion authored by
    Judge Newman and joined by Judge Lohier, the court
    stated that the public access channels in Manhattan are a
    public forum for purposes of the First Amendment. Rea-
    soning that “public forums are usually operated by gov-
    ernments,” the court concluded that MNN is a state actor
    subject to First Amendment constraints. 

Id., at 306–307.

    
    
    Judge Lohier added a concurring opinion, explaining that
    MNN also qualifies as a state actor for the independent
    reason that “New York City delegated to MNN the tradi-
    tionally public function of administering and regulating
    speech in the public forum of Manhattan’s public access
    channels.” 

Id., at 309.

    
    
       Judge Jacobs dissented in relevant part, opining that
    MNN is not a state actor. He reasoned that a private
    entity’s operation of an open forum for speakers does not
    render the host entity a state actor. Judge Jacobs further
    stated that the operation of public access channels is not a
    traditional, exclusive public function.
       We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among
    the Courts of Appeals on the question whether private
    operators of public access cable channels are state actors
    subject to the First Amendment. 586 U. S. __ (2018).

                                  II
       Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides in
    relevant part that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridg-
    ing the freedom of speech.” Ratified in 1868, the Four-
    teenth Amendment makes the First Amendment’s Free
    Speech Clause applicable against the States: “No State
    shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
    privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;
    nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or
    property, without due process of law . . . .” §1. The text
    and original meaning of those Amendments, as well as
    this Court’s longstanding precedents, establish that the
    Free Speech Clause prohibits only governmental abridg-
    ment of speech. The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit
    private abridgment of speech. See, e.g., Denver Area Ed.

       In accord with the text and structure of the Constitu-
    tion, this Court’s state-action doctrine distinguishes the
    government from individuals and private entities. See
    Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic
    Assn., 

[531 U.S. 288](/opinion/118403/brentwood-academy-v-tennessee-secondary-school-
athletic-assn/)

    
    
    , 295–296 (2001). By enforcing that
    constitutional boundary between the governmental and
    the private, the state-action doctrine protects a robust
    sphere of individual liberty.
       Here, the producers claim that MNN, a private entity,
    restricted their access to MNN’s public access channels
    because of the content of the producers’ film. The produc-
    ers have advanced a First Amendment claim against
    MNN. The threshold problem with that First Amendment
    claim is a fundamental one: MNN is a private entity.
       Relying on this Court’s state-action precedents, the
    6   MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    producers assert that MNN is nonetheless a state actor
    subject to First Amendment constraints on its editorial
    discretion. Under this Court’s cases, a private entity can
    qualify as a state actor in a few limited circumstances—
    including, for example, (i) when the private entity per-
    forms a traditional, exclusive public function, see, e.g.,
    

Jackson, [419 U.S., at 352](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    –354; (ii) when the government
    compels the private entity to take a particular action, see,
    e.g., Blum v. Yaretsky, 

[457 U.S. 991](/opinion/110768/blum-v-yaretsky/)

    
    
    , 1004–1005 (1982); or
    (iii) when the government acts jointly with the private
    entity, see, e.g., Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 

[457 U.S. 922](/opinion/110766/lugar-v-edmondson-oil-co/)

    
    
    , 941–942 (1982).
       The producers’ primary argument here falls into the
    first category: The producers contend that MNN exercises
    a traditional, exclusive public function when it operates
    the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system
    in Manhattan. We disagree.
                                 A
       Under the Court’s cases, a private entity may qualify as
    a state actor when it exercises “powers traditionally exclu-
    sively reserved to the State.” 

Jackson, [419 U.S., at 352](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    .
    It is not enough that the federal, state, or local govern-
    ment exercised the function in the past, or still does. And
    it is not enough that the function serves the public good or
    the public interest in some way. Rather, to qualify as a
    traditional, exclusive public function within the meaning
    of our state-action precedents, the government must have
    traditionally and exclusively performed the function. See

       The relevant function in this case is operation of public
    access channels on a cable system. That function has
    not traditionally and exclusively been performed by
    government.
       Since the 1970s, when public access channels became a
    regular feature on cable systems, a variety of private and
    public actors have operated public access channels, includ-

      1 Relatedly, this Court has recognized that a private entity may, un-
    
    der certain circumstances, be deemed a state actor when the govern-
    ment has outsourced one of its constitutional obligations to a private
    entity. In West v. Atkins, for example, the State was constitutionally
    obligated to provide medical care to prison inmates.

    14–17 (1987).
       The history of public access channels in Manhattan
    further illustrates the point. In 1971, public access chan-
    nels first started operating in Manhattan. See D. Bren-
    ner, M. Price, & M. Meyerson, Cable Television and Other
    Nonbroadcast Video §6:29, p. 6–47 (2018). Those early
    Manhattan public access channels were operated in large
    part by private cable operators, with some help from
    private nonprofit organizations. See G. Gillespie, Public
    Access Cable Television in the United States and Canada
    37–38 (1975); Janes, History and Structure of Public
    Access Television, 39 J. Film & Video, No. 3, pp. 15–17
    (1987). Those private cable operators continued to operate
    the public access channels until the early 1990s, when
    MNN (also a private entity) began to operate the public
    access channels.
       In short, operating public access channels on a cable
    system is not a traditional, exclusive public function within
    the meaning of this Court’s cases.
                                 B
       To avoid that conclusion, the producers widen the lens
    and contend that the relevant function here is not simply
    the operation of public access channels on a cable system,
    but rather is more generally the operation of a public
    forum for speech. And according to the producers, opera-
    tion of a public forum for speech is a traditional, exclusive
    public function.
       That analysis mistakenly ignores the threshold state-
    action question. When the government provides a forum
                     Cite as: 587 U. S. ____ (2019)            9
    
                         Opinion of the Court
    
    for speech (known as a public forum), the government may
    be constrained by the First Amendment, meaning that the
    government ordinarily may not exclude speech or speakers
    from the forum on the basis of viewpoint, or sometimes
    even on the basis of content. See, e.g., Southeastern Pro-
    motions, Ltd. v. Conrad,

       By contrast, when a private entity provides a forum for
    speech, the private entity is not ordinarily constrained by
    the First Amendment because the private entity is not a
    state actor. The private entity may thus exercise editorial
    discretion over the speech and speakers in the forum.
    This Court so ruled in its 1976 decision in Hudgens v.
    NLRB. There, the Court held that a shopping center
    owner is not a state actor subject to First Amendment
    requirements such as the public forum 

doctrine. [424 U.S., at 520](/opinion/109390/hudgens-v-nlrb/)

       The Hudgens decision reflects a commonsense principle:
    Providing some kind of forum for speech is not an activity
    that only governmental entities have traditionally per-
    formed. Therefore, a private entity who provides a forum
    for speech is not transformed by that fact alone into a
    state actor. After all, private property owners and private
    lessees often open their property for speech. Grocery
    stores put up community bulletin boards. Comedy clubs
    host open mic nights. As Judge Jacobs persuasively ex-
    plained, it “is not at all a near-exclusive function of the
    state to provide the forums for public expression, politics,
    information, or 

entertainment.” 882 F.3d, at 311

       In short, merely hosting speech by others is not a tradi-
    tional, exclusive public function and does not alone trans-
    form private entities into state actors subject to First
    Amendment constraints.
       If the rule were otherwise, all private property owners
    and private lessees who open their property for speech
    would be subject to First Amendment constraints and
    would lose the ability to exercise what they deem to be
    appropriate editorial discretion within that open forum.
    Private property owners and private lessees would face
    the unappetizing choice of allowing all comers or closing
    the platform altogether. “The Constitution by no means
    requires such an attenuated doctrine of dedication of
    private property to public use.” 

Hudgens, [424 U.S., at 519 ](/opinion/109390/hudgens-v-nlrb/)

    
    
    (internal quotation marks omitted). Benjamin Franklin
    did not have to operate his newspaper as “a stagecoach,
    with seats for everyone.” F. Mott, American Journalism
    55 (3d ed. 1962). That principle still holds true. As the
    Court said in Hudgens, to hold that private property own-
    ers providing a forum for speech are constrained by the
    First Amendment would be “to create a court-made law
    wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which
    private ownership of property rests in this 

country.” [424 U.S., at 517 ](/opinion/109390/hudgens-v-nlrb/)

    
    
    (internal quotation marks omitted). The
    Constitution does not disable private property owners and
    private lessees from exercising editorial discretion over
    speech and speakers on their property. 2

    this Court’s case law, including Hudgens. But Hudgens is
    sound, and we therefore reaffirm our holding in that case. 3

      2 A distinct question not raised here is the degree to which the First
    
    Amendment protects private entities such as Time Warner or MNN
    from government legislation or regulation requiring those private
    entities to open their property for speech by others. Cf. Turner Broad-

       Next, the producers retort that this case differs from
    Hudgens because New York City has designated MNN to
    operate the public access channels on Time Warner’s cable
    system, and because New York State heavily regulates
    MNN with respect to the public access channels. Under
    this Court’s cases, however, those facts do not establish
    that MNN is a state actor.
       New York City’s designation of MNN to operate the
    public access channels is analogous to a government li-
    cense, a government contract, or a government-granted
    monopoly. But as the Court has long held, the fact that
    the government licenses, contracts with, or grants a mo-
    nopoly to a private entity does not convert the private
    entity into a state actor—unless the private entity is
    performing a traditional, exclusive public function. See,

    read to suggest that private property owners or private lessees are
    subject to First Amendment constraints whenever they dedicate their
    private property to public use or otherwise open their property for
    speech.

       Numerous private entities in America obtain govern-
    ment licenses, government contracts, or government-
    granted monopolies. If those facts sufficed to transform a
    private entity into a state actor, a large swath of private
    entities in America would suddenly be turned into state
    actors and be subject to a variety of constitutional con-
    straints on their activities. As this Court’s many state-
    action cases amply demonstrate, that is not the law. Here,
    therefore, the City’s designation of MNN to operate the
    public access channels on Time Warner’s cable system
    does not make MNN a state actor.
       So, too, New York State’s extensive regulation of MNN’s
    operation of the public access channels does not make
    MNN a state actor. Under the State’s regulations, air
    time on the public access channels must be free, and pro-
    gramming must be aired on a first-come, first-served
    basis. Those regulations restrict MNN’s editorial discre-
    tion and in effect require MNN to operate almost like a
    common carrier. But under this Court’s cases, those re-
    strictions do not render MNN a state actor.
       In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., the leading case
    on point, the Court stated that the “fact that a business is
    subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its
    action into that of the 

State.” [419 U.S., at 350](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    . In that
    case, the Court held that “a heavily regulated, privately
    owned utility, enjoying at least a partial monopoly in the
    providing of electrical service within its territory,” was not
    a state actor. 

[Id., at 358. ](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    The Court explained that the
    “mere existence” of a “regulatory scheme”—even if “exten-
    sive and detailed”—did not render the utility a state actor.

    and n. 7. Nor did it matter whether the State
    had authorized the utility to provide electric service to the

    community, or whether the utility was the only entity
    providing electric service to much of that community.
       This case closely parallels Jackson. Like the electric
    utility in Jackson, MNN is “a heavily regulated, privately
    owned” entity. 

[Id., at 358. ](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    As in Jackson, the regulations
    do not transform the regulated private entity into a state
    actor.
       Put simply, being regulated by the State does not make
    one a state actor. See

    177. As the Court’s cases have explained, the “being
    heavily regulated makes you a state actor” theory of state
    action is entirely circular and would significantly endan-
    ger individual liberty and private enterprise. The theory
    would be especially problematic in the speech context,
    because it could eviscerate certain private entities’ rights
    to exercise editorial control over speech and speakers on
    their properties or platforms.        Not surprisingly, as
    JUSTICE THOMAS has pointed out, this Court has “never
    even hinted that regulatory control, and particularly
    direct regulatory control over a private entity’s First
    Amendment speech rights,” could justify subjecting the
    regulated private entity to the constraints of the First
    Amendment. Denver

    (opinion
    concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
       In sum, we conclude that MNN is not subject to First
    Amendment constraints on how it exercises its editorial
    discretion with respect to the public access channels. To
    be sure, MNN is subject to state-law constraints on its
    editorial discretion (assuming those state laws do not
    violate a federal statute or the Constitution). If MNN
    violates those state laws, or violates any applicable con-
    tracts, MNN could perhaps face state-law sanctions or
    liability of some kind. We of course take no position on
    any potential state-law questions. We simply conclude

                         Opinion of the Court
    
    that MNN, as a private actor, is not subject to First
    Amendment constraints on how it exercises editorial
    discretion over the speech and speakers on its public
    access channels.
                                 III
       Perhaps recognizing the problem with their argument
    that MNN is a state actor under ordinary state-action
    principles applicable to private entities and private prop-
    erty, the producers alternatively contend that the public
    access channels are actually the property of New York
    City, not the property of Time Warner or MNN. On this
    theory, the producers say (and the dissent agrees) that
    MNN is in essence simply managing government property
    on behalf of New York City.
       The short answer to that argument is that the public
    access channels are not the property of New York City.
    Nothing in the record here suggests that a government
    (federal, state, or city) owns or leases either the cable
    system or the public access channels at issue here. Both
    Time Warner and MNN are private entities. Time Warner
    is the cable operator, and it owns its cable network, which
    contains the public access channels. MNN operates those
    public access channels with its own facilities and equip-
    ment. The City does not own or lease the public access
    channels, and the City does not possess a formal easement
    or other property interest in those channels. The fran-
    chise agreements between the City and Time Warner do
    not say that the City has any property interest in the
    public access channels. On the contrary, the franchise
    agreements expressly place the public access channels
    “under the jurisdiction” of MNN. App. 22. Moreover, the
    producers did not allege in their complaint that the City
    has a property interest in the channels. And the produc-
    ers have not cited any basis in state law for such a conclu-
    sion. Put simply, the City does not have “any formal

    (opinion of THOMAS, J.).
      It does not matter that a provision in the franchise
    agreements between the City and Time Warner allowed
    the City to designate a private entity to operate the public
    access channels on Time Warner’s cable system. Time
    Warner still owns the cable system. And MNN still oper-
    ates the public access channels. To reiterate, nothing in
    the franchise agreements suggests that the City possesses
    any property interest in Time Warner’s cable system, or in
    the public access channels on that system.
      It is true that the City has allowed the cable operator,
    Time Warner, to lay cable along public rights-of-way in
    the City. But Time Warner’s access to public rights-of-
    way does not alter the state-action analysis. For Time
    Warner, as for other cable operators, access to public
    rights-of-way is essential to lay cable and construct a
    physical cable infrastructure. See Turner Broadcasting
    System, Inc. v. FCC, 

[512 U.S. 622](/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/)

    
    
    , 628 (1994). But the
    same is true for utility providers, such as the electric
    utility in Jackson. Put simply, a private entity’s permis-
    sion from government to use public rights-of-way does not
    render that private entity a state actor.
      Having said all that, our point here should not be read
    too broadly. Under the laws in certain States, including
    New York, a local government may decide to itself operate
    the public access channels on a local cable system (as
    many local governments in New York State and around
    the country already do), or could take appropriate steps to
    obtain a property interest in the public access channels.
    Depending on the circumstances, the First Amendment
    might then constrain the local government’s operation of
    the public access channels. We decide only the case before
    us in light of the record before us.

                          Opinion of the Court
    
                              *    *    *
       It is sometimes said that the bigger the government, the
    smaller the individual. Consistent with the text of the
    Constitution, the state-action doctrine enforces a critical
    boundary between the government and the individual, and
    thereby protects a robust sphere of individual liberty.
    Expanding the state-action doctrine beyond its traditional
    boundaries would expand governmental control while
    restricting individual liberty and private enterprise. We
    decline to do so in this case.
       MNN is a private entity that operates public access
    channels on a cable system. Operating public access
    channels on a cable system is not a traditional, exclusive
    public function. A private entity such as MNN who opens
    its property for speech by others is not transformed by
    that fact alone into a state actor. Under the text of the
    Constitution and our precedents, MNN is not a state actor
    subject to the First Amendment. We reverse in relevant
    part the judgment of the Second Circuit, and we remand
    the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
    
                                                 It is so ordered.

               APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT

       JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, with whom JUSTICE GINSBURG,
    JUSTICE BREYER, and JUSTICE KAGAN join, dissenting.
       The Court tells a very reasonable story about a case that
    is not before us. I write to address the one that is.
       This is a case about an organization appointed by the
    government to administer a constitutional public forum.
    (It is not, as the Court suggests, about a private property
    owner that simply opened up its property to others.) New
    York City (the City) secured a property interest in public-
    access television channels when it granted a cable fran-
    chise to a cable company. State regulations require those
    public-access channels to be made open to the public on
    terms that render them a public forum. The City con-
    tracted out the administration of that forum to a private
    organization, petitioner Manhattan Community Access
    Corporation (MNN). By accepting that agency relation-
    ship, MNN stepped into the City’s shoes and thus qualifies
    as a state actor, subject to the First Amendment like any
    other.

       A cable-television franchise is, essentially, a license to
    create a system for distributing cable TV in a certain area.
    It is a valuable right, usually conferred on a private com-

    , 628 (1994). A private company cannot enter
    a local cable market without one. §541(b)(1).
       Cable companies transmit content through wires that
    stretch “between a transmission facility and the television
    sets of individual subscribers.” 

Id., at 627–628.

    
    
    Creating
    this network of wires is a disruptive undertaking that
    “entails the use of public rights-of-way and easements.”
    

Id., at 628.

    
    
       New York State authorizes municipalities to grant cable
    franchises to cable companies of a certain size only if those
    companies agree to set aside at least one public access
    channel. 16 N. Y. Codes, Rules & Regs. §§895.1(f ),
    895.4(b)(1) (2016). New York then requires that those
    public-access channels be open to all comers on “a first-
    come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.” §895.4(c)(4).
    Likewise, the State prohibits both cable franchisees and
    local governments from “exercis[ing] any editorial control”
    over the channels, aside from regulating obscenity and
    other unprotected content. §§895.4(c)(8)–(9).
                                 B
       Years ago, New York City (no longer a party to this suit)
    and Time Warner Entertainment Company (never a party
    to this suit) entered into a cable-franchise agreement.
    App. 22. Time Warner received a cable franchise; the City
    received public-access channels. The agreement also
    provided that the public-access channels would be operated
    by an independent, nonprofit corporation chosen by the
    Manhattan borough president. But the City, as the prac-
    tice of other New York municipalities confirms, could have
    instead chosen to run the channels itself. See §895.4(c)(1);
    Brief for Respondents 35 (citing examples).
       MNN is the independent nonprofit that the borough
    president appointed to run the channels; indeed, MNN

    appears to have been incorporated in 1991 for that precise
    purpose, with seven initial board members selected by the
    borough president (though only two thus selected today).
    See App. 23; Brief for Respondents 7, n. 1. The City ar-
    ranged for MNN to receive startup capital from Time
    Warner and to be funded through franchise fees from
    Time Warner and other Manhattan cable franchisees.
    App. 23; Brief for New York County Lawyers Association
    (NYCLA) as Amicus Curiae 27; see also App. to Brief for
    Respondents 19a. As the borough president announced
    upon MNN’s formation in 1991, MNN’s “central charge is
    to administer and manage all the public access channels of
    the cable television systems in Manhattan.” App. to Brief
    for NYCLA as Amicus Curiae 1.
       As relevant here, respondents DeeDee Halleck and
    Jesus Papoleto Melendez sued MNN in U. S. District
    Court for the Southern District of New York under 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1983. They alleged that the public-access chan-
    nels, “[r]equired by state regulation and [the] local fran-
    chise agreements,” are “a designated public forum of
    unlimited character”; that the City had “delegated control
    of that public forum to MNN”; and that MNN had, in turn,
    engaged in viewpoint discrimination in violation of re-
    spondents’ First Amendment rights. App. 39.
       The District Court dismissed respondents’ First
    Amendment claim against MNN. The U. S. Court of
    Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that dismissal,
    concluding that the public-access channels “are public
    forums and that [MNN’s] employees were sufficiently
    alleged to be state actors taking action barred by the First
    Amendment.” 

882 F.3d 300

    
    
    , 301–302 (2018). Because
    the case before us arises from a motion to dismiss, re-
    spondents’ factual allegations must be accepted as true.

                                 II
       I would affirm the judgment below. The channels are
    clearly a public forum: The City has a property interest in
    them, and New York regulations require that access to
    those channels be kept open to all. And because the City
    (1) had a duty to provide that public forum once it granted
    a cable franchise and (2) had a duty to abide by the First
    Amendment once it provided that forum, those obligations
    did not evaporate when the City delegated the administra-
    tion of that forum to a private entity. Just as the City
    would have been subject to the First Amendment had it
    chosen to run the forum itself, MNN assumed the same
    responsibility when it accepted the delegation.
                                  A
       When a person alleges a violation of the right to free
    speech, courts generally must consider not only what was
    said but also in what context it was said.
       On the one hand, there are “public forums,” or settings
    that the government has opened in some way for speech
    by the public (or some subset of it). The Court’s prece-
    dents subdivide this broader category into various subcat-
    egories, with the level of leeway for government regulation
    of speech varying accordingly. See Minnesota Voters
    Alliance v. Mansky, 585 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op.,
    at 7). Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 

[487 U.S. 474](/opinion/112134/frisby-v-schultz/)

    
    
    , 480 (1988)

    , 669, 679,
    and n. 12 (2010) (program for registered student organiza-
    tions, limited public forum). But while many cases turn
    on which type of “forum” is implicated, the important
    point here is that viewpoint discrimination is impermissi-
    ble in them all. See Good News Club v. Milford Central
                         Cite as: 587 U. S. ____ (2019)                    5

    , 106 (2001).
       On the other hand, there are contexts that do not fall
    under the “forum” rubric. For one, there are contexts in
    which the government is simply engaging in its own
    speech and thus has freedom to select the views it prefers.
    See, e.g., Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veter-
    ans, Inc., 576 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (slip op., at 6–7)
    (specialty license plates); Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,

    , 467–469, 481 (2009) (privately donated
    permanent monuments in a public park). 1 In addition,
    there are purely private spaces, where the First Amend-
    ment is (as relevant here) inapplicable.           The First
    Amendment leaves a private store owner (or homeowner),
    for example, free to remove a customer (or dinner guest)
    for expressing unwanted views. See, e.g., Lloyd Corp. v.
    Tanner, 

[407 U.S. 551](/opinion/108592/lloyd-corp-v-tanner/)

    
    
    , 569–570 (1972). In these settings,
    there is no First Amendment right against viewpoint
    discrimination.
       Here, respondents alleged viewpoint discrimination.
    App. 39. So a key question in this case concerns what the
    Manhattan public-access channels are: a public forum of
    some kind, in which a claim alleging viewpoint discrimina-
    tion would be cognizable, or something else, such as gov-
    ernment speech or purely private property, where picking
    favored viewpoints is appropriately commonplace. 2 Nei-
    ther MNN nor the majority suggests that this is an in-
    ——————
      1 That  does not mean that no restrictions apply at all to the govern-
    ment’s expression in such spaces, but it does mean that the government
    can pick and choose among different views. See Walker, 576 U. S., at
    ___, ___–___ (slip op., at 6, 17–18);

    .
       2 The channels are not, of course, a physical place. Under the Court’s
    
    precedents, that makes no difference: Regardless of whether something
    “is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic
    sense, . . . the same principles are applicable.” Rosenberger v. Rector
    and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,

    stance of government speech. This case thus turns first
    and foremost on whether the public-access channels are or
    are not purely private property. 3
                                  1
       This Court has not defined precisely what kind of gov-
    ernmental property interest (if any) is necessary for a
    public forum to exist. See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal
    Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 

[473 U.S. 788](/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/)

    
    
    , 801 (1985) (“a
    speaker must seek access to public property or to private
    property dedicated to public use”). But see ante, at 11, n. 3
    (appearing to reject the phrase “private property dedicated
    to public use” as “passing dicta”). I assume for the sake of
    argument in this case that public-forum analysis is inap-
    propriate where the government lacks a “significant prop-
    erty interest consistent with the communicative purpose of
    the forum.” Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consor-
    tium, Inc. v. FCC, 

518 U.S. 727

    
    
    , 829 (1996) (THOMAS, J.,
    concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).
       Such an interest is present here. As described above,
    New York State required the City to obtain public-access
    channels from Time Warner in exchange for awarding a
    cable franchise. 

See supra, at 2

    
    
    . The exclusive right to
    use these channels (and, as necessary, Time Warner’s
    infrastructure) qualifies as a property interest, akin at the
    very least to an easement.
       The last time this Court considered a case centering on
    public-access channels, five Justices described an interest
    like the one here as similar to an easement. Although
    JUSTICE BREYER did not conclude that a public-access
    channel was indeed a public forum, he likened the cable

      3 As discussed below, it is possible that some (or even many) public-
    
    access channels are government speech. The channels that MNN
    administers, however, are clearly better thought of as a public forum
    given the New York regulations mandating open and equal access. See
    infra, at 9–10, and n. 7.

    793 (noting that the entire cable system’s existence stems
    from the municipality’s decision to grant the franchise).
    What those five Justices suggested in 1996 remains true
    today.
       “A common idiom describes property as a ‘bun-
    dle of sticks’—a collection of individual rights which, in
    certain combinations, constitute property.” United States
    v. Craft, 

[535 U.S. 274](/opinion/118497/united-states-v-craft/)

    
    
    , 278 (2002). Rights to exclude and
    to use are two of the most crucial sticks in the bundle. See
    

[id., at 283. ](/opinion/118497/united-states-v-craft/)

    
    
    “State law determines . . . which sticks are in a
    person’s bundle,” 

[id., at 278, ](/opinion/118497/united-states-v-craft/)

    
    
    and therefore defining prop-
    erty itself is a state-law exercise. 4 As for whether there is
    a sufficient property interest to trigger First Amendment
    forum analysis, related precedents show that there is.
       As noted above, there is no disputing that Time Warner
    owns the wires themselves. See 

Turner, [512 U.S., at 628](/opinion/117869/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-
fcc/)

    
    
    .
    If the wires were a road, it would be easy to define the
    public’s right to walk on it as an easement. See, e.g., In re
    India Street, 

29 N.Y. 2d

    
    
    97, 100–103, 272 N. E 2d 518,
    ——————
       4 The parties have not pointed this Court to any New York law defini-
    
    tively establishing the status of the channels. But even if there were
    uncertainty about the status of the channels under New York law, that
    would not be a reason to resolve the case against respondents (plaintiffs
    below) at the motion to dismiss stage. See infra, at 12, n. 9, 14.

                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting
    
    518–520 (1971). Similarly, if the wires were a theater,
    there would be no question that a government’s long-term
    lease to use it would be sufficient for public-forum pur-
    poses. Southeastern 

Promotions, [420 U.S., at 547](/opinion/109214/southeastern-promotions-ltd-v-

    , 555. But
    some may find this case more complicated because the
    wires are not a road or a theater that one can physically
    occupy; they are a conduit for transmitting signals that
    appear as television channels. In other words, the ques-
    tion is how to understand the right to place content on
    those channels using those wires.
       The right to convey expressive content using someone
    else’s physical infrastructure is not new. To give another
    low-tech example, imagine that one company owns a
    billboard and another rents space on that billboard. The
    renter can have a property interest in placing content on
    the billboard for the lease term even though it does not
    own the billboard itself. See, e.g., Naegele Outdoor Adver-
    tising Co. of Minneapolis v. Lakeville,

       The same principle should operate in this higher tech
    realm. Just as if the channels were a billboard, the City
    obtained rights for exclusive use of the channels by the
    public for the foreseeable future; no one is free to take the
    channels away, short of a contract renegotiation. Cf.
    

Craft, [535 U.S., at 283](/opinion/118497/united-states-v-craft/)

    
    
    . The City also obtained the right
    to administer, or delegate the administration of, the chan-
    nels. The channels are more intangible than a billboard,
    but no one believes that a right must be tangible to qualify
    as a property interest. See, e.g., Armstrong v. United

    property). And it is hardly unprecedented for a govern-
    ment to receive a right to transmit something over a pri-
    vate entity’s infrastructure in exchange for conferring
    something of value on that private entity; examples go
    back at least as far as the 1800s. 5
       I do not suggest that the government always obtains a
    property interest in public-access channels created by
    franchise agreements. But the arrangement here is con-
    sistent with what the Court would treat as a governmen-
    tal property interest in other contexts. New York City
    gave Time Warner the right to lay wires and sell cable TV.
    In exchange, the City received an exclusive right to send
    its own signal over Time Warner’s infrastructure—no
    different than receiving a right to place ads on another’s
    billboards. Those rights amount to a governmental prop-
    erty interest in the channels, and that property interest is
    clearly “consistent with the communicative purpose of the
    forum,” Denver 

Area, [518 U.S., at 829 ](/opinion/118061/denver-area-ed-telecommunications-

    which New York law grants the public open and equal
    access.

      With the question of a governmental property interest
    resolved, it should become clear that the public-access
    channels are a public forum. 6 Outside of classic examples

    like sidewalks and parks, a public forum exists only where
    the government has deliberately opened up the setting for
    speech by at least a subset of the public.

    . “Accordingly, the Court has looked to the
    policy and practice of the government,” as well as the
    nature of the property itself, “to ascertain whether it
    intended to designate a place not traditionally open to
    assembly and debate as a public forum.” See 

[ibid.](/opinion/111517/cornelius-v-naacp-legal-defense-ed-fund-inc/) For
example, a

    
    
    state college might make its facilities open to
    student groups, or a municipality might open up an audi-
    torium for certain public meetings. See

       The requisite governmental intent is manifest here. As
    noted above, New York State regulations require that the
    channels be made available to the public “on a first-come,
    first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.” 16 N. Y. Codes,
    Rules & Regs. §895.4(c)(4); see also §§895.4(c)(8)–(9). The
    State, in other words, mandates that the doors be wide
    open for public expression. MNN’s contract with Time
    Warner follows suit. App. 23. And that is essentially how
    MNN itself describes things. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9 (“We
    do not prescreen videos. We—they come into the door. We
    put them on the air”). 7 These regulations “evidenc[e] a
    clear intent to create a public forum.”

    private agent. When MNN took on the responsibility of
    administering the forum, it stood in the City’s shoes and
    became a state actor for purposes of 

42 U.S. C

    
    
    . §1983.
      This conclusion follows from the Court’s decision in West
    v. Atkins, 

[487 U.S. 42 ](/opinion/112116/west-v-atkins/)

    
    
    (1988). The Court in West unani-
    mously held that a doctor hired to provide medical care to
    state prisoners was a state actor for purposes of §1983.
    

Id., at 54;

    
    
    see also 

id., at 58

    
    
    (Scalia, J., concurring in part
    and concurring in judgment). Each State must provide
    medical care to prisoners, the Court explained, 

id., at 54,

    
    
    and when a State hires a private doctor to do that job, the
    doctor becomes a state actor, “ ‘clothed with the authority
    of state law,’ ” 

id., at 55.

    
    
    If a doctor hired by the State
    abuses his role, the harm is “caused, in the sense relevant
    for state-action inquiry,” by the State’s having incarcer-
    ated the prisoner and put his medical care in that doctor’s
    hands. 

Ibid. The fact that

    
    
    the doctor was a private contractor, the
    Court emphasized, made no difference. 

Ibid. It was “the

    
    
    physician’s function within the state system,” not his
    private-contractor status, that determined whether his
    conduct could “fairly be attributed to the State.” 

Id., at 55–56.

    
    
    Once the State imprisoned the plaintiff, it owed
    him duties under the Eighth Amendment; once the State
    delegated those duties to a private doctor, the doctor
    became a state actor. See ibid.; see also 

id., at 56–57.

    
    
    If
    the rule were any different, a State would “ ‘be free to
    contract out all services which it is constitutionally obli-
    gated to provide and leave its citizens with no means
    for vindication of those rights, whose protection has
    been delegated to ‘private’ actors, when they have been
    denied.’ ” 

Id., at 56,

    
    
    n. 14.
      West resolves this case. Although the settings are dif-
    ferent, the legal features are the same: When a govern-
    ment (1) makes a choice that triggers constitutional obli-
    gations, and then (2) contracts out those constitutional
    12   MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                           SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting
    
    responsibilities to a private entity, that entity—in agree-
    ing to take on the job—becomes a state actor for purposes
    of §1983. 8
       Not all acts of governmental delegation necessarily
    trigger constitutional obligations, but this one did. New
    York State regulations required the City to secure public-
    access channels if it awarded a cable franchise. 16 N. Y.
    Codes, Rules & Regs. §895.4(b)(1). The City did award a
    cable franchise. The State’s regulations then required the
    City to make the channels it obtained available on a “first-
    come, first-served, nondiscriminatory basis.” 9 §895.4(c)(4).
    ——————
       8 Governments are, of course, not constitutionally required to open
    
    prisons or public forums, but once they do either of these things,
    constitutional obligations attach. The rule that a government may not
    evade the Constitution by substituting a private administrator, mean-
    while, is not a prison-specific rule. More than 50 years ago, for exam-
    ple, this Court made clear in Evans v. Newton, 

[382 U.S. 296 ](/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/)

    
    
    (1966),
    that the city of Macon, Georgia, could not evade the Fourteenth
    Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause by handing off control of a park
    to a group “of ‘private’ trustees.” 

[Id., at 301. ](/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/)

    
    
    Rather, “the public
    character of [the] park require[d] that it be treated as a public institu-
    tion subject to the command of the Fourteenth Amendment, regardless
    of who ha[d] title under state law.” 

[Id., at 302. ](/opinion/107137/evans-v-newton/)

    
    
       9 Accordingly, this is not a case in which a private entity has been
    
    asked to exercise standardless discretion. See, e.g., American Mfrs.
    Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 

[526 U.S. 40](/opinion/118268/american-mfrs-mut-ins-co-v-sullivan/)

    
    
    , 52 (1999). Had New York law
    left MNN free to choose its favorite submissions, for example, a differ-
    ent result might well follow.
       MNN has suggested to this Court that its contract with Time Warner
    allows it “to curate content, to decide to put shows together on one of
    our channels or a different channel.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 6; see Reply Brief
    9. But MNN’s contract cannot defeat New York law’s “first-come, first-
    served, nondiscriminatory” scheduling requirement, 16 N. Y. Codes,
    Rules & Regs. §895.4(c)(4), and the discretion MNN asserts seems to be
    at most some limited authority to coordinate the exact placement and
    timing of the content it is obliged to accept indiscriminately, see Tr. of
    Oral Arg. 25–26. That seems akin to the authority to make reasonable
    time, place, and manner provisions, which is consistent with adminis-
    tering any public forum. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 

[491 U.S. 781](/opinion/112315/ward-v-rock-against-racism/)

    
    
    , 791 (1989). As for any factual assertions about how the channels

    That made the channels a public forum.

    10. Opening a public forum, in turn, entailed First
    Amendment obligations.
       The City could have done the job itself, but it instead
    delegated that job to a private entity, MNN. MNN could
    have said no, but it said yes. (Indeed, it appears to exist
    entirely to do this job.) By accepting the job, MNN accepted
    the City’s responsibilities. See 

West, [487 U.S., at 55](/opinion/112116/west-v-atkins/)

    The First Amendment does not fall silent simply because a
    government hands off the administration of its constitu-
    tional duties to a private actor.
                                 III
       The majority acknowledges that the First Amendment
    could apply when a local government either (1) has a
    property interest in public-access channels or (2) is more
    directly involved in administration of those channels than
    the City is here. Ante, at 15. And it emphasizes that it
    “decide[s] only the case before us in light of the record
    before us.” 

[Ibid.](/opinion/112116/west-v-atkins/) These case-specific qualifiers

    
    
    sharply
    limit the immediate effect of the majority’s decision, but
    that decision is still meaningfully wrong in two ways.
    First, the majority erroneously decides the property ques-
    tion against the plaintiffs as a matter of law. Second, and
    more fundamentally, the majority mistakes a case about
    the government choosing to hand off responsibility to an
    agent for a case about a private entity that simply enters a
    marketplace.

    so the facts asserted against it must be accepted as true. Hernandez v.
    Mesa, 582 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (per curiam) (slip op., at 1). And any
    uncertainty about the facts or New York law, in any event, would be a
    reason to vacate and remand, not reverse.

    mental property interest here, ante, at 14–15, does not
    hold up. The majority focuses on the fact that “[b]oth
    Time Warner and MNN are private entities”; that Time
    Warner “owns its cable network, which contains the public
    access channels”; and that “MNN operates those public
    access channels with its own facilities and equipment.”
    Ante, at 14; see also ante, at 15. Those considerations
    cannot resolve this case. The issue is not who owns the
    cable network or that MNN uses its own property to oper-
    ate the channels. The key question, rather, is whether the
    channels themselves are purely private property. An
    advertiser may not own a billboard, but that does not
    mean that its long-term lease is not a property interest.
    

See supra, at 8

    
    
    .
      The majority also says that “[n]othing in the record here
    suggests that a government . . . owns or leases either the
    cable system or the public access channels at issue here.”
    Ante, at 14. But the cable system itself is irrelevant, and,
    as explained above, the details of the exchange that yielded
    Time Warner’s cable franchise suggest a governmental
    property interest in the channels. 

See supra, at 6

    
    
    –9.
      The majority observes that “the franchise agreements
    expressly place the public access channels ‘under the
    jurisdiction’ of MNN,” ante, at 14, but that language sim-
    ply describes the City’s appointment of MNN to administer
    the channels. The majority also chides respondents for
    failing to “alleg[e] in their complaint that the City has a
    property interest in the channels,” ibid., but, fairly read,
    respondents’ complaint includes such an assertion. 10 In

      10 Respondents alleged that the City “created an electronic public
    
    forum” and “delegat[ed] control of that forum to” MNN. App. 17. They
    further alleged that “[a]lmost all cable franchise agreements require
    cable operators—as a condition for easements to use the public rights-
    of-way—to dedicate some channels for programming by the public,” 

id., at 20,

    
    
    invoked the state regulations requiring the designation of a
    channel here,

    any event, any ambiguity or imprecision does not justify
    resolving the case against respondents at the motion-to-
    dismiss stage. To the extent the majority has doubts
    about respondents’ complaint—or factual or state-law
    issues that may bear upon the existence of a property
    interest—the more prudent course would be to vacate and
    remand for the lower courts to consider those matters
    more fully. In any event, as I have explained, the best
    course of all would be to affirm.
                                  B
       More fundamentally, the majority’s opinion erroneously
    fixates on a type of case that is not before us: one in which
    a private entity simply enters the marketplace and is then
    subject to government regulation. The majority swings
    hard at the wrong pitch.
       The majority focuses on Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison
    Co., 

[419 U.S. 345 ](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    (1974), which is a paradigmatic example
    of a line of cases that reject §1983 liability for private
    actors that simply operate against a regulatory backdrop.
    Jackson emphasized that the “fact that a business is
    subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its
    action into that of the State.” 

Id., at 350;

    
    
    accord, ante, at
    12. Thus, the fact that a utility company entered the
    marketplace did not make it a state actor, even if it was
    highly regulated. See

      The Jackson line of cases is inapposite here. MNN is
    not a private entity that simply ventured into the market-
    place. It occupies its role because it was asked to do so by
    the City, which secured the public-access channels in
    exchange for giving up public rights of way, opened those
    channels up (as required by the State) as a public forum,
    and then deputized MNN to administer them. That dis-
    tinguishes MNN from a private entity that simply sets up
    shop against a regulatory backdrop. To say that MNN is
    nothing more than a private organization regulated by the
    government is like saying that a waiter at a restaurant is

       11 There was a time when this Court’s precedents may have portended
    
    the kind of First Amendment liability for purely private property

    ing Marsh to cover a private shopping center to the extent that it
    sought to restrict speech about its businesses). But the Court soon
    stanched that trend. See Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,

    reluctant to find a “public function” when it comes to “private commer-

    an independent food seller who just happens to be highly
    regulated by the restaurant’s owners.
       The majority also relies on the Court’s statements that
    its “public function” test requires that a function have
    been “traditionally and exclusively performed” by the
    government. Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted); see 

Jackson, [419 U.S., at 352](/opinion/109125/jackson-v-metropolitan-edison-co/)

    
    
    . Properly understood, that rule cabins
    liability in cases, such as Jackson, in which a private actor
    ventures of its own accord into territory shared (or regu-
    lated) by the government (e.g., by opening a power com-
    pany or a shopping center). The Court made clear in West
    that the rule did not reach further, explaining that “the
    fact that a state employee’s role parallels one in the pri-
    vate sector” does not preclude a finding of state 

action. 487 U.S., at 56

    
    
    , n. 15.
       When the government hires an agent, in other words,
    the question is not whether it hired the agent to do some-
    thing that can be done in the private marketplace too. If
    that were the key question, the doctor in West would not
    have been a state actor. Nobody thinks that orthopedics is
    a function “traditionally exclusively reserved to the State,”

    .
       The majority consigns West to a footnote, asserting that
    its “scenario is not present here because the government
    has no [constitutional] obligation to operate public access
    channels.” Ante, at 7, n. 1. The majority suggests that
    West is different because “the State was constitutionally
    obligated to provide medical care to prison inmates.” Ante,
    at 7, n. 1. But what the majority ignores is that the State
    in West had no constitutional obligation to open the prison
    or incarcerate the prisoner in the first place; the obligation
    to provide medical care arose when it made those prior
    choices.
       The City had a comparable constitutional obligation
    here—one brought about by its own choices, made against
    a state-law backdrop. The City, of course, had no constitu-
    18   MANHATTAN COMMUNITY ACCESS CORP. v. HALLECK
    
                          SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting
    
    tional obligation to award a cable franchise or to operate
    public-access channels. But once the City did award a
    cable franchise, New York law required the City to obtain
    public-access channels, 

[see supra, at 2](/opinion/118403/brentwood-academy-v-tennessee-secondary-
school-athletic-assn/)

    
    
    , and to open them
    up as a public forum, 

[see supra, at 9](/opinion/118403/brentwood-academy-v-tennessee-secondary-
school-athletic-assn/)

    
    
    –10. That is when the
    City’s obligation to act in accordance with the First
    Amendment with respect to the channels arose. That is
    why, when the City handed the administration of that
    forum off to an agent, the Constitution followed. 

See supra, at 10

       The majority is surely correct that “when a private
    entity provides a forum for speech, the private entity is
    not ordinarily constrained by the First Amendment.”
    Ante, at 9. That is because the majority is not talking
    about constitutional forums—it is talking about spaces
    where private entities have simply invited others to come
    speak. A comedy club can decide to open its doors as wide
    as it wants, but it cannot appoint itself as a government
    agent. The difference is between providing a service of
    one’s own accord and being asked by the government to
    administer a constitutional responsibility (indeed, here,
    existing to do so) on the government’s behalf. 13

    (1988), by contrast, the prison was obli-
    gated to provide health care in accordance with the Eighth Amendment to
    its prisoners once it incarcerated them, and here, the City was required
    to provide a public forum to its residents in accordance with the First
    Amendment once it granted the cable franchise.

       13 Accordingly, the majority need not fear that “all private property
    
    owners and private lessees who open their property for speech [c]ould
    be subject to First Amendment constraints.” Ante, at 10. Those kinds
    of entities are not the government’s agents; MNN is. Whether such
    entities face “extensive regulation” or require “government licenses,
    government contracts, or government-granted monopolies,” ante, at 12,

       To see more clearly the difference between the cases on
    which the majority fixates and the present case, leave
    aside the majority’s private comedy club. Imagine instead
    that a state college runs a comedy showcase each year,
    renting out a local theater and, pursuant to state regula-
    tions mandating open access to certain kinds of student
    activities, allowing students to sign up to perform on a
    first-come, first-served basis. Cf. Rosenberger v. Rector
    and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 

[515 U.S. 819 ](/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-
va/)

    
    
    (1995). After a
    few years, the college decides that it is tired of running the
    show, so it hires a performing-arts nonprofit to do the job.
    The nonprofit prefers humor that makes fun of a certain
    political party, so it allows only student acts that share its
    views to participate. Does the majority believe that the
    nonprofit is indistinguishable, for purposes of state action,
    from a private comedy club opened by local entrepreneurs?
       I hope not. But two dangers lurk here regardless. On
    the one hand, if the City’s decision to outsource the chan-
    nels to a private entity did render the First Amendment
    irrelevant, there would be substantial cause to worry
    about the potential abuses that could follow. Can a state
    university evade the First Amendment by hiring a non-
    profit to apportion funding to student groups? Can a city
    do the same by appointing a corporation to run a munici-
    pal theater? What about its parks?
       On the other hand, the majority hastens to qualify its
    decision, see ante, at 7, n. 1, 15, and to cabin it to the
    specific facts of this case, ante, at 15. Those are prudent
    limitations. Even so, the majority’s focus on Jackson still
    risks sowing confusion among the lower courts about how
    and when government outsourcing will render any abuses
    that follow beyond the reach of the Constitution.
       In any event, there should be no confusion here. MNN
    ——————
    is immaterial, so long as they have not accepted the government’s
    request to fulfill the government’s duties on its behalf.

    is not a private entity that ventured into the marketplace
    and found itself subject to government regulation. It was
    asked to do a job by the government and compensated
    accordingly. If it does not want to do that job anymore, it
    can stop (subject, like any other entity, to its contractual
    obligations). But as long as MNN continues to wield the
    power it was given by the government, it stands in the
    government’s shoes and must abide by the First Amend-
    ment like any other government actor.
                                  IV
      This is not a case about bigger governments and smaller
    individuals, ante, at 16; it is a case about principals and
    agents. New York City opened up a public forum on public-
    access channels in which it has a property interest. It
    asked MNN to run that public forum, and MNN accepted
    the job. That makes MNN subject to the First Amend-
    ment, just as if the City had decided to run the public
    forum itself.
      While the majority emphasizes that its decision is nar-
    row and factbound, ante, at 15, that does not make it any
    less misguided. It is crucial that the Court does not con-
    tinue to ignore the reality, fully recognized by our prece-
    dents, that private actors who have been delegated consti-
    tutional responsibilities like this one should be
    accountable to the Constitution’s demands. I respectfully
    dissent.
